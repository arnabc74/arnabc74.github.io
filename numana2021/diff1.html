<h1><a
name="Differential equations">Differential equations</a></h1>


We shall start with a familiar physics example that will lead to
an unmanageable differential equation.

<h2><a
name="An example: simple pendulum">An example: simple pendulum</a></h2>

During our high school days we are taught that a simple pendulum executes an
approximately simple harmonic motion <i>if the angle of swing is small.</i> However, high
school textbooks avoid discussing the general case: the motion of a
pendulum that may swing to larger angles. The main reason is that this leads
to an unmanageable differential equation that cannot be solved without a computer.
<p></p>
Consider the following diagram. 
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/pendu.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Simple pendulum</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
Taking $O$ as the origin and positive
$x$- $y$- and $\theta$-directions as shown, the position of
the bob is
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
x &amp;  = &amp;  L\sin(\theta)\\
y &amp;  = &amp;  -L\cos(\theta).
\end{eqnarray*}$$
Remember that $\theta $ is a function of time $t.$ So the above
equations actually mean 
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
x(t) &amp;  = &amp;  L\sin(\theta(t))\\
y(t) &amp;  = &amp;  -L\cos(\theta(t)).
\end{eqnarray*}$$

The forces on the bob along the positive $x$- and $y$-directions
are, respectively,
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
F_x &amp;  = &amp;  -T\sin(\theta)\\
F_y &amp;  = &amp;  T\cos(\theta)-mg.
\end{eqnarray*}$$
Here $T$ is the tension in the rod. It is also a function of
$t.$

<p></p>

To derive the equations of motion we shall use Newton's second law of
motion, which says
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
F_x &amp;  = &amp;  m x''\\
F_y &amp;  = &amp;  m y'',
\end{eqnarray*}$$
where $x''$, $y''$   denote the second derivatives of $x(t)$, $y(t)$ with respect
to $t.$

<p></p>

Differentiating $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ twice we get
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
x'' &amp;  = &amp;  -L  \sin(\theta)(\theta')^2 + L \cos(\theta)\theta ''\\
y'' &amp;  = &amp;  L  \cos(\theta)(\theta')^2 + L  \sin(\theta)\theta ''.
\end{eqnarray*}$$

Putting these in Newton's second law, and simplifying, we get
$$
\theta '' = -\frac gL \sin(\theta).
$$
At this point most  textbooks use
the ``$\sin(\theta)\approx \theta $'' approximation for "small"
$\theta$ to reduce the above differential equation to 
$$
\theta '' = -\frac gL \theta,
$$
which can be solved easily by hand to produce simple harmonic
motion. The approximation is pretty good if the pendulum swings
within $4^\circ$. But not all pendulums swing within that
range. What if you have a pendulum that swings $30^\circ?$
That's what we are going to explore now.
<p></p>
We first reduce the second
order differential equation $\theta '' = -\frac gL\sin\theta$ 
to a <i>system</i> of first order equations.
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta ' &amp;  = &amp;  \omega\\
\omega' &amp;  = &amp;  -\frac gL \sin\theta.
\end{eqnarray*}$$
Notice that $(\theta',\omega')$ is given as a function
of $(\theta,\omega).$ The entire motion of the pendulum is
determined if we know $(\theta,\omega)$ at some instant. So
we call $(\theta,\omega)$ the <i>phase</i> of the system. We
are given the initial phase of the system, <i>i.e.</i>, we know from which initial angle we have released the
pendulum, and with what angular velocity. Our aim is to know the phase at
all time points during the swing.

<p></p>
Thus, at $t=t_0$ (specified number), we know 
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta &amp; = &amp; \theta_0\mbox{ (specified number)},\\
\omega &amp; = &amp; \omega_0\mbox{ (specified number)}.
\end{eqnarray*}$$ 
We want to know the values $\theta(t)$  and $\omega(t)$  at any given $t &gt; t_0.$
<p></p>
Thanks to the differential equations, we also know 
the rate at which they are increasing at $t=t_0:$
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta'(t_0) &amp; = &amp; \omega_0,\\
\omega'(t_0) &amp; = &amp; -\frac gL\sin \theta_0.
\end{eqnarray*}$$ 
Now advance time a little  to $t_1=t_0+\delta t$, say. By this
time $\theta$ and $\omega$ will roughly change to
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_1 &amp; = &amp; \theta_0 + \theta'(t_0)\delta t = \theta_0+\omega_0\delta t\\
\omega_1 &amp; = &amp; \omega_0 +\omega'(t_0)\delta t =
\omega_0-\frac gL\sin \theta_0 \delta t.
\end{eqnarray*}$$ 

So we get the phase (approximately) at  $t_1= t_0+\delta t.$
<p></p>
Now we keep on advancing time by  $\delta t$ increments. The same 
logic may be used repeatedly to give, at $t_k = t_0+k\cdot\delta t,$
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_k &amp; = &amp; \theta_{k-1} + \omega_{k-1}\delta t\\
\omega_k &amp; = &amp; \omega_{k-1} -\frac gL\sin \theta_{k-1} \delta t.
\end{eqnarray*}$$ 
Admittedly, this is a rather crude approximation. However, if $\delta t$  is pretty small, the accuracy increases. 
<p></p>
Let's explore this numerically using R. First, we decide about a
time resolution, and the number of steps to run the process:
of time points:
<font color="red">
<pre>
dt = 0.1
n = 100
</pre>
</font>
Next,
we create three arrays, one for $t$, one for $\theta$,
and  the other
for $\omega$:
<font color="red">
<pre>
tm = numeric(n)
theta = numeric(n)
omega = numeric(n)
</pre>
</font>
Set the initial values:
<font color="red">
<pre>
tm[1] = 0
theta[1] = 30 * (pi/180)
omega[1] = 0;
</pre>
</font>
Note that array indices in R start from 1 (and not from 0, as in C).
Run the following loop to populate the arrays.
<font color="red">
<pre>
for(k in 2:n) {
   tm[k] = tm[k-1] + dt
   theta[k] = theta[k-1] + omega[k-1]*dt
   omega[k] = omega[k-1] - 9.8*sin(theta[k-1])*dt
}
</pre>
</font>
Finally, make a plot:
<font color="red">
<pre>
plot(tm,theta, ty='l')
</pre>
</font>

<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/diffplot1.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>
</center>
Yikes! What nonsense!

<p></p>
We want to play with the value of $\delta t$ (and the number
of steps). It is difficult to re-run all these lines of R
everytime we change the values. So at this point it is a good
idea to turn the above R code into a function:
<font color="red">
<pre>
pendulum = function(t0,theta0,n,dt) {
  tm = rep(0,n)
  theta = rep(0,n);
  omega = rep(0,n);
  tm[1] = t0
  theta[1] = theta0;
  omega[1] = 0;

  
  C = -9.8;

  for(k in 2:n) {
    tm[k] = tm[k-1] + dt
    theta[k] = theta[k-1] + omega[k-1]*dt
    omega[k] = omega[k-1] + C*sin(theta[k-1])*dt
  }
  plot(tm,theta,type="l")
  return(list(time=tm,angle=theta,vel=omega))
}
</pre>
</font>
Now we may simply write 
<font color="red">
<pre>
result1 = pendulum(0,30*(pi/180),100,0.1)
</pre>
</font>
to produce the same plot as before. Also the
variable <code>result1</code> will store the numerical values in
case we need them. 
<p></p>
Now let's increase the time resolution by setting $\delta
t=0.01$. To maintain the same time range don't forget to
change $n$ accordingly:
<font color="red">
<pre>
pendulum(0, 30* (pi/180), 1000, 0.01)
</pre>
</font>
The result is 
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/diffplot2.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Much better</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
But still do you see something fishy?
 <p></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Execute the above code with different initial values, and see if
the output changes as it should. Make a plot of the velocity over
time. Draw the phase diagram, <i>i.e.</i>, a parametric plot
of $(\theta(t), \omega(t))$ with $t$ as the parameter.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Modify the code to allow the user to specify a non-zero initial velocity. 
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Plot the potential energy, kinetic energy and total mechanical
energy of the system as  functions of time. Check if the total
mechanical energy curve is indeed a horizontal straight line, as
it should be.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Try to produce an animation of the pendulum in R. Hint: the function 
<font color="red">
<pre>
Sys.sleep(0.1)
</pre>
</font>
will cause R to wait for 0.1 second. 
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<a name="pendu"><b>
<div id="pendu">PROJECT:</div>
</b></a>&nbsp;
The rod in the above pendulum is an inextensible one. So we could treat
$L$ as a constant. What if we replace it by a spring with constant
$\gamma?$ Then the tension in the spring will be
$$
T = \gamma\cdot \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}- \ell\right),
$$ 
where $\ell$  is the unstretched length of the spring. 

Numerically solve these assuming that 
$$
\ell=4,~~x(0) = 1,~~y(0)= -2,~~x'(0)=y'(0)=0.
$$
Animate to see if the solution looks natural. You may need to tweak $\delta t$  to make it look more natural (<i>i.e.</i>,
 to make it more accurate).

<h2><a
name="A closer look: Euler's method">A closer look: Euler's method</a></h2>
Our differential equation was of the form
$$y'(t) = f(y),$$
where $y(t_0) = y_0.$ In our pendulum example we had $y
= (\theta,\omega).$ Also 
$$
f(y) \equiv f(\theta, \omega) = \left(\omega, -\frac gL\sin \theta\right).
$$
The crude approximation that we used is called <b>Euler's
method</b>. It works with the more general form:
$$
y'(t) = f(t,y),\quad y(t_0) = y_0.
$$
We shall be given the function
$f(\cdot,\cdot)$ and the initial values $t_0,y_0.$ We are also  given a
positive integer $n$ and a step size $\delta t.$ We have to find out the
function $y(t)$ at the points $t_1,...,t_n,$ where
$$
t_i = t_0+i \delta t.
$$
Euler's method works by making local linear
approximations to the unknown $y(t).$ 
<p></p>
For this we need to know the derivative of $y(t).$  If
at some instant $t$  we can guess the value of $y(t),$  then the value of $y'(t)$  may be obtained from 
differential equation: $y'(t)=f(t,y(t)).$
<p></p>
 Here we are starting from  $y_0 =
y(t_0).$ So we know that $y'(t_0) = f(t_0,y_0).$ This is the slope
of the tangent to $y(t)$ at $t=t_0.$ Follow this tangent for
a little time $\delta t$ to arrive at $y_1 =
y_0+f(t_0,y_0)\delta t.$ The point
$(t_1,y_1)$ may not lie exactly on the curve of $y(t).$ But if $\delta t$
is small, then this should lie close to it. So we take $y_1$ as an
approximation to $y(t_1).$ Now we repeat the process again to get 
$y_2 = y_1+\delta t\,f(t_1,y_1).$ In general, we  define 
$$
y_k = y_{k-1}+\delta t\, f(t_{k-1},y_{k-1}) \quad\mbox{ for } k=1,...,n.
$$
This is <b>Euler's method</b>. 
<p></p>
How good is this method? To explore this we shall try out a simple example, where
the solution is known. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose we are working with $f(t,y) = -\sin(t+y).$ In other
words, we are solving $\frac{dy}{dt} = -\sin(t+y).$ We shall
start from the point $\left(0,-\frac \pi2\right),$ <i>i.e.</i>, $y = -\frac \pi2$
when $t=0.$ 
<p></p>
Of course,
we can solve it analytically, by taking $v = t+y.$
Then $\frac{dv}{dt}  = 1+\frac{dy}{dt}= 1-\sin(v),$ which may be solved by direct integration. The
answer is (check!)
$$
y = -\sin ^{-1} \left( \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} \right) - t.
$$
We
shall compare our approximation with this to 
see how Euler's method performs. We shall take $n$ steps
in $[0,2].$ Then the Euler iterations are
$$
y_i = y_{i-1} - \frac 2n\times \sin(t_{i-1}+y_{i-1}) 
$$
for $i=1,...,n$ starting with $t_0 = 0$ and $y_0 =-\frac \pi2.$

<p></p>
The result (with $n=10$) is shown in the following graph. The continuous curve is the true solution. The dashed 
polyline (with 10 segments) is Euler's approximation:

<h2><a
name="Taylor's method">Taylor's method</a></h2>
One problem with Euler's method is that unless $\delta t$ is very small the
$y_i$'s may move away from the curve of $y(t).$ Taylor's
method generalises Euler's method to improve the accuracy. In Euler's
method we used local linear approximations (tangents)
to $y(t)$ at each $t_i:$
$$
y(t) \approx y(t_i) + y'(t_i)(t-t_i).
$$
These are just the first two terms of the Taylor expansion
of $y(t):$
$$
y(t_i) + y'(t_i)(t-t_i) + \frac{y''(t_i)}{2}(t-t_i)^2
+\cdots \frac{y^{(k)}(t_i)}{k!} (t-t_i)^k + \cdots 
$$
In Taylor's method we take more terms from this series. Thus,
1-st order Taylor's method is the same as Euler's method, while
the $k$-th order Taylor's method uses
$$
y(t)\approx y(t_i) + y'(t_i)(t-t_i) + \frac{y''(t_i)}{2}(t-t_i)^2
+\cdots \frac{y^{(k)}(t_i)}{k!} (t-t_i)^k.
$$
<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;Check that it is the unique $\leq k$ degree polynomial that has the same
derivatives as $y(t)$ up to order $k$  at $t_i.$<img src="../image/box.png"></p>



<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;Solve the same differential equation
 $y'(t) = -\sin(t+y)$ with $y(0) = -\frac \pi2$
over $[0,2]$
using 2-nd order Taylor method.
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
The 2-nd degree Taylor polynomial for $y(t)$ at
any $t_{k-1}$ is 
$$
y(t_{k-1}) + y'(t_{k-1})(t-t_{k-1}) + \frac{y''(t_{k-1})}{2} (t-t_{k-1})^2.
$$
For this we need $y'(t_{k-1})$  and $y''(t_{k-1}).$  These may be obtained approximately as follows.
<p></p>
We can write the differential equation as
$$
y'(t) = -\sin(t+y(t)).
$$
Differentiating w.r.t. $t,$
$$
y''(t) = -\cos(t+y(t))(1+y'(t)).
$$
Hence
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
y'(t_{k-1}) &amp; = &amp; -\sin(t_{k-1}+y(t_{k-1}))\\
y''(t_{k-1}) &amp; = &amp; -\cos(t_{k-1}+y(t_{k-1}))(1+y'(t_{k-1})).
\end{eqnarray*}$$
<p></p>
As before we take a grid of values in $[0,2],$ say $10$ steps. So
there are 11 points starting with $t_0=1$ and ending
with $t_{10}=2.$ The general formula for $t_k$ is 
$$
t_k = 1+k\cdot\delta t,
$$
where $\delta t = \frac 2n.$
<p></p>
So the 2nd order Taylor iterations are
$$y_{k} = y_{k-1} +\frac 2ny'(t_{k-1}) + \frac{2}{n^2}y''(t_{k-1}).$$

The result is shown below. The red curve is the 2nd order Taylor approximation with $n=10.$  The dashed polyline is
 the Euler's approximation (<i>i.e.</i>, 1st order Taylor) with the same $n.$

<h2><a
name="Gravity well">Gravity well</a></h2>
This is a more complicated example.
<p></p>
Many science museums (including the Birla Industrial and
Technological Museum here in Kolkata) has a model to demonstrate
Einstein's theory of gravitation. The model consists of some
balls rolling on a
large curved plastic funnel. See
this <a href="https://youtu.be/dNyK3jP5gRI?t=23">Youtube video here</a>. The funnel
represents the space-time warped by a heavy star (yellow ball) sitting at the
center. The smaller balls tend to roll into
the cavity, but owing to their initial tangential velocities end up
orbiting the star.
<p></p>

 Consider the following funnel-like
surface. It is obtained by rotating the curve $z = f(y)$ around the
the $z$-axis. For instance, $f(y)=\sqrt{y-1}$ would produce a
surface like the following.
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/funnel.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Ball in funnel</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
A ball is moving along the inner surface of the funnel. We shall ignore
the radius of the ball and the friction of the surface. (Thus the ball is a point mass slipping,
not rolling, on the funnel.) We know the
initial position and velocity of the ball. We want to find out the path
that the ball will follow. 

<p></p>

There are two forces acting on the ball: its weight and the reaction of
the surface. The first works downwards, and so is 
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}0\\0\\-mg
\end{array}\right].
$$
The reaction acts inwards along the normal to the surface at the current
position of the ball. Let the current position of the ball be 
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}t\\y\\f(u)
\end{array}\right],
$$
where $u = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}.$ A little coordinate geometry shows that
the normal lies along 
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}-x\\-y\\u/f'(u)
\end{array}\right].
$$
If this is not clear, then think like this:
<blockquote>
First consider the curve $z = f(y)$ and the point on the
graph at $y = u.$ The slope of the tangent there
is $f'(u)$ and hence the slope of the normal
is $-\frac{1}{f'(u)}.$ Understand how we get from this the normal arrow
shown below:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/curve.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The arrow has coordinates $\left( 1,-\frac{1}{f'(u)} \right)$</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
Now when we rotate the curve around the $z$-axis to generate
the surface, the normal arrow also rotates with the curve. The
following diagram shows a snapshot during the rotation:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/surf.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The arrow has coordinates $\left( \frac xu,
\frac yu, ,-\frac{1}{f'(u)} \right)$</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
The pink plane is the rotated version of the graph paper from the
earlier 2D graph of $z = f(y).$ If the new position
of $P$ is at $(x,y,0),$ then we must
have $\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = u.$  From this you should be able to
see that a vector along the (outward) normal direction is $\left( \frac xu,
\frac yu, ,-\frac{1}{f'(u)} \right)$, or equivalently, $\left( x,
y,-\frac{u}{f'(u)} \right)$. So the inward normal direction is given
by its negative: $\left( -x, -y, \frac{u}{f'(u)} \right)$

</blockquote>

So the reaction force is
$$
R\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}-x\\-y\\u/f'(u)
\end{array}\right],
$$
for some unknown function $R$ of $t$ (time). So we have the equation of
motion:
$$
m\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}x''\\y''\\z''
\end{array}\right] = R\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}-x\\-y\\u/f'(u)
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}0\\0\\-mg
\end{array}\right].
$$
or, dividing by $m,$
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}x''\\y''\\z''
\end{array}\right] = \tilde R\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}-x\\-y\\u/f'(u)
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}0\\0\\-g
\end{array}\right],
$$
where $\tilde R = \frac Rm.$

<p></p>
Notice
that $z$ is a known function of $x$ and $y.$ 
Find
$z''$ in terms of $x,y$ and their derivatives. Then use
the 3rd equation to get 
$$
\tilde R = \frac{f'(u)\left(x'^2+y'^2-u'^2\right)/u+u'^2f''(u)+g}
           {u\left(f'(u)+\frac{1}{f'(u)}\right)}.
$$
Thus, now $\tilde R$ is expressed in terms of $x$
and $y$ (and their derivatives).
With this $\tilde R$ we now have just two equations in two unknowns:
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
x'' &amp;  = &amp;  -x\tilde R\\
y'' &amp;  = &amp;  -y\tilde R.
\end{eqnarray*}$$

<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
You can make the above problem more realistic by taking friction into
account. Remember that kinetic frictional force has magnitude proportional
to the normal reaction and acts opposite to the velocity vector.

Many other physics examples are
discussed in the web page <a href="http://www.myphysicslab.com">www.myphysicslab.com</a>. That page
has many interactive animations. However, they use a method more
sophisticated than what we have used. We
 shall learn that method
in the second half of this course.
