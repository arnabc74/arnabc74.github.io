Some students have flown some paper airplanes, and have measured
the distances travelled. Each plane has been flown a number of
times (1 or 2 or 3 or 4), and the average distance is recorded.

Distance: Average distance (in feet) flown by the plane.

Design: Type of the plane

Paper: Type of paper used.

flaps: Does it have flaps?

Weight: Is it weighted (e.g., has a heavy paper clip attached to the body)
to enhance stability?

Rep: Number of repetions over which the average has been taken.
