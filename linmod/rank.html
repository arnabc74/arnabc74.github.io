<h1><a
name="Intuitive understanding of rank of design matrix">Intuitive understanding of rank of design matrix</a></h1>
We have seen that the rank of the design matrix plays an
important role in determining uniqueness of the least squares
solution. The solution is unique if and only if $X$ is full
column rank, <i>i.e.</i>, rank equals number of columns. In practice,
however, this condition may not be met. We can of course apply
some linear algebra algorithm (like Gaussian elimination) to find
the rank and/or find a subset of columns that
span $\col(X).$ However, it is often possible to avoid these
numerical algorithms and resolve the problem intuitively. That is
what we are going to learn now.

<h2><a
name="Guessing if rank $&lt;$ number of columns">Guessing if rank $&lt;$ number of columns</a></h2>

Since we know that this is equivalent to nonuniqueness of least
squares solution, hence we try to tweak one least squares
solution into another. If we succeed then the rank must be less
than number of columns. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Consider the 1-way ANOVA model: $y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i +
\epsilon_{ij}.$

<p></p>
Suppose that I give you some least squares solution $\h \mu$
and $\h \alpha_i$'s. Now the intuitive thinking goes like
this:
<blockquote>
Since $y_{ij}\approx \mu + \alpha_i,$ we may think as
if $\mu + \alpha_i$'s are being "watched"
by $y_{ij}$'s.
If any of the $\mu + \alpha_i$'s change, then it would ring
an alarm bell.
</blockquote>
But it is quite possible that we can tweak $\mu $ and $\alpha_i$'s so
that $\mu + \alpha_i$'s never change, then that would give us
a new least squares solution. For instance, add 5 to $\mu,$
and adjust by subtracting 5 from all the $\alpha_i$'s. 
<p></p>
This shows that $X$ is not full column rank. 
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>

Here is another example.

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Again we consider a 1-way ANOVA model: $y_{ij} = \mu_i +
\epsilon_{ij}.$ Here the $\mu_i$'s are "watched". So
can't do any tweaking without getting detected. Hence the design
matrix is full column rank here.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<h2><a
name="Guessing $r(X)$">Guessing $r(X)$</a></h2>
The same intuitive way of thinking can often allow us to guess
the $r(X)$.

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Again consider the model: $y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i +
\epsilon_{ij}$ for $i=1,...,p,$ say. The range
of $j$ does not really matter for finding $r(X)$.
<a href="javascript:hideShow('');">(Why?)</a>
<div id="" style="display:none;background-color:#ffcccc;">It only controls how many times
each row of $X$ is repeated. Repeating the same row
multiple times does not affect the rank.</div> 

<p></p>
There are $p+1$ columns in $X.$ We have already seen
that $X$ is not full column rank. Hence $r(X) &lt; p+1.$
To guess $r(X)$ we shall again play the "tweak parameters
without setting off the alarm" game. But this time we shall
impose an extra constraint: pick any parameter (just any!),
say $\mu,$ and never tweak it. Now you'll see that no
tweaking is possible. Since you can tweak
neither $\mu+\alpha_i$ nor $\mu $, hence you cannot
tweak $\alpha_i$ either. Thus, just <i>one</i> constraint is
enough to prevent tweaking. The conclusion is: $r(X)$ is
exactly <i>one</i> less than the number of columns.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>

Here is a more complicated example.

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
The 2-way ANOVA model without interaction:$y_{ij} = \mu+\alpha_i+\beta_j+\epsilon_{ij}.$
<p></p>
Here the "watched" quantities are $\mu+\alpha_i+\beta_j.$
Clearly, we can add something to $\mu$ and adjust by
subtracting that amount from all the $\alpha_i$'s (or all
the the $\beta_j$'s). So not full column rank.
<p></p>
To guess the exact rank, let's impose an additional
constraint: "Thou shalt not tweak $\mu$."
<p></p>
Still we can manage to tweak the $\alpha_i$'s
and $\beta_j$'s without letting off the alarm bell. For
instance, add 5 to all the $\alpha_i$'s and subtract the
same amount from all the $\beta_j$'s.
<p></p>
OK, pick any other parameter <i>that is not already fixed by earlier
constraints</i> (say $\alpha_1$) and impose
a new constraint: "Thou shalt not tweak $\alpha_1$ either."
<p></p>
Now, $\mu $ and $\alpha_1$ both being fixed,
and $\mu+\alpha_1+\beta_j$'s being watched, we cannot tweak
any of the $\beta_j$'s. So none of the
other $\alpha_i$'s can be tweaked either. Hence no tweaking
at all! And we needed just <i>two</i> constraints.
<p></p>
Conclusion: $r(X)$ is <i>two</i> less than the number of columns.

<h2><a
name="Reducing $X$ to a full column rank matrix">Reducing $X$ to a full column rank matrix</a></h2>

"Reducing $X$ to a full column rank matrix" means, linear algebraically,  picking a subset of columns
of $X$ that constitute a basis for $\col(X).$ Finding a
column-echelon form for $X$ is one possible sledge hammer to
break this peanut. However, our "tweak without letting off the
alarm" game again comes to help. Indeed, it is preferable to the
sledge hammer method, because the particular least squares
solution that we shall get by the intuitive method also has
better interpretability. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;Consider the 1-way ANOVA model once again: $y_{ij} =
\mu+\alpha_i+\epsilon_{ij}.$

<p></p>
Here is one possible scenario where it could be used. We have
three different fertilisers <i>None</i>, <i>Compost</i> and <i>NPK</i>. We want to see
their effect on the yield of paddy. Here the
constraint $\alpha_1 = 0$ is a suitable one, since <i>None</i> is
like a reference case. With this constraint the remaining
parameters have the following interpretation:
<ul>

<li>$\mu$ is the effect of no fertiliser.</li>

<li>$\alpha_2$ is the extra effect due to <i>Compost</i>,</li>

<li>$\alpha_3$ is the extra effect due to <i>NPK</i>.</li>

</ul>
However, if the three fertilisers were <i>Mg</i>, <i>Compost</i> and <i>NPK</i>, then
a more natural constraint would be $\sum \alpha_i = 0,$
leading to the following interpretation:
<ul>

<li>$\mu$ is the overall mean effect.</li>

<li>$\alpha_i$ is the extra effect due to the $i$-th fertiliser.</li>

</ul>
Another natural constraint would be: $\mu = 0.$ Here the
interpretation is even simpler:
<ul>

<li>$\alpha_i$ is the effect of the $i$-th fertiliser.</li>

</ul>
However, most people will prefer the constraint $\sum \alpha_i =
0$ to the constraint $\mu = 0,$ because under the former
the signs of the $\h \alpha_i$'s immediately gives a clue to
which fertiliser is a good and which is bad. 
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>
Each such constraint is effectively choosing a basis
of $\col(X)$ leading to a unique least squares
solution. Each software has its favourite constraint, which
may not be the natural one for a given context. But it is easy to
convert one least squares solution to another that satisfies a
natural set of constraints. The next example illustrates this.

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Consider the 1-way ANOVA model $y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i +
\epsilon_{ij}.$ for $i=1,2,3$ and $j=1,...,10.$
<p></p>
R uses the constraint $\alpha_1 = 0.$
<p></p>
However, we want the constraint $\sum \alpha_i = 0.$ 
<p></p>
If the estimates produced by R are
$$
\h \mu = 23.4, \quad \h \alpha_1 = 0,\quad \h \alpha_2 =
45.9,\quad \h \alpha_3 = -3.4,
$$
then find the estimates that satisfies our constraint.
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
Just average the $\h \alpha_i$'s and subtract this from all
the $\h \alpha_i$'s. Adjust by adding the same quantity to $\h \mu.$

<p></p>
Notice that you really do not need to know what constraint(s) R
uses internally in order to impose your set of constraints.<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<h1><a
name="Exercises">Exercises</a></h1>

<ol type="">

<li>For the model $y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i +
\epsilon_{ij},$ a software produces the estimates
$$
\h \mu = 23.4, \quad \h \alpha_1 = 2.0,\quad \h \alpha_2 =
45.9,\quad \h \alpha_3 = -3.4.
$$
Find the estimates under the constraint $\mu = 0.$
</li>


<li>Consider the model: $y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j +
\gamma_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk},$ for $i=1,2,3$
and $j=1,2$ and $k=1,...,5.$ Is the design matrix full
column rank? Find its rank. Find two possible sets of
constraints to make the solution unique.</li>


<li>This exercises will give you an idea why the "tweak without
letting off the alarm" game always detects whether $X$ is
not full column rank. Consider a linear
model $\v y = X \v \beta + \v \epsilon,$ where $\v \beta =
(\beta_1,...,\beta_4).$
It is seen that if we tweak by adding 5 to $\beta_1$ and
subtracting 3 from $\beta_2$ and adding 1 to $\beta_3$
(leaving $\beta_4$ unaltered), then the alarm does not go
off. In other words, we added the vector $(5,-3,1,0)'$
to $\v \beta$ without firing the alarm. We shall call such a 
vector  a <i>tweak vector</i> (not a standard term).
<ol type="a">

<li> Show that the
set of all tweak vectors is a subspace.</li>

<li>How is this subspace related to $X?$</li>

<li>Prove that the
existence of a nonnull tweak vector implies $X$ is not full column rank.</li>

</ol>

</li>


<li>This exercise is a continuation of the last. Here you'll see
why the "tweak without letting off the alarm" game always
guesses the rank correctly. Again consider the same linear model
as in the last problem.  Suppose that the only tweak
vector of the form $(0,0,a,b)'$ is the zero vector. What
can you conclude about $r(X)?$ </li>



<li>Consider the linear model $y_{i_1\cdots i_t} = \mu +
\alpha_{1i_1}+\cdots + \alpha_{ti_t}+\epsilon_{i_1\cdots
i_t}.$ What is the rank of the design matrix here?</li>
