<HEAD1>How I make my videos</HEAD1>
It is a rather complex process, that I have built up bit by bit
over the years. I shall  outline the main steps first:
<OL>
<LI>I first create a script, a detailed write up of what I want
to say. This script is divided into multiple sessions
(punctuated by black title screens and a short melody).</LI>
<LI>Next, I create the pictures and texts that will be
shown. These are inserted at appropriate points in the
script.</LI>
<LI>Then I load the images in my mobile phone, and shoot the
video. This is done with a rather novel technology. While the
camera app is running, another app (written by me) is also
running in parallel and shows the pictures as overlays on the
screen). So during the shooting I can see myself as well as the
images just as the viewer would see them in the final video. So
I can point to various parts of the images.</LI>
<LI>The result of the shooting consists of one video file per
session, plus a cue file produced by my app that stores the 
timings of the overlay entry and exit points. </LI>
<LI>I download these from the phone back to my laptop, and
process it with another software (written by me) to produce the
final video.</LI>
</OL>

Though I rely too heavily on software written by me, part of the
process may be delegated to existing (free and open source)
software.
