Let <M>f:X\to\{0,1\}</M>  be continuous. Now <M>\{0\}</M>  and <M>\{1\}</M>  are both open in the codomain. 

So <M>f ^{-1}(\{0\})</M>  and <M>f ^{-1}(\{1\})</M>  must be open in the domain. Also, these are complements of each other.
 Hence both must be closed. 

So both are clopen. Since the domain is connected, hence the only clopen subsets in it are <M>\phi</M>  and <M>X.</M>  

So either <M>f ^{-1}(\{1\}) = X</M>  and <M>f ^{-1}(\{0\}) = \phi,</M>  or <M>f ^{-1}(\{1\}) = \phi</M>  and <M>f ^{-1}(\{0\}) = X.</M>
