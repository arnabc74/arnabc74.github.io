A very similar argument shows that  <M>G(0) = 0.</M>
<BECAUSE>
If <M>F(x)</M>  never attains the value 0, then clearly <M>G(0)=0.</M>  

Otherwise, we can use the sup argument as in case 2: Let <M>a = \sup\{x~:~F(x)\leq 0\}</M>, which
 is defined since <M>F(x)</M>  attains the value 0. 

Then 
 <M>G(0) = P(Y\leq 0) = P(F(X)\leq 0) =
 P(X\leq a) = F(a) = 0,</M>  by continuity argument as in case 2.
