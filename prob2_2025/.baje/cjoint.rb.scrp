We have <M>F_X(x)  = \int_{-\infty}^x \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(s,t)\,dt\,ds.</M>

This is a (univariate) CDF. We know how to find a density for it (if one exists): we have to
 differentiate it and check if integral of the derivative gives back the CDF. 

Here, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,  <M>F_X'(x)  = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x,t)\,dt.</M>  Hence the result.
