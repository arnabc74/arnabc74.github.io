It has a partial converse, which is also important.
<THM>
If <M>X</M>  is a continuous random variable with CDF <M>F,</M>  then <M>F(X)\sim Unif(0,1).</M>
</THM>
<PF>
Clearly, <M>Y=F(X)</M>  can only take values in <M>[0,1].</M>  So <M>P(Y\leq y) = 0</M>  if
 <M>y<0</M>  or if <M>y>1.</M>  

Take any <M>y\in[0,1].</M>  Then <M>P(Y\leq y) = P(F(X)\leq y)= P(X\leq F^-(y))= F(F^-(y))=y.</M>
