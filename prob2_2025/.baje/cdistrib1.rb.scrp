<ALERT/>Please note that the video contains a mistake (and so does not match the text below, which has been corrected). In
 the video I have wrongly stated <M>F(F^-(y))=y</M>, while actually we should have <M>F(F^-(y))\geq y</M>, as we have given
in the theorem below. I shall correct the video soon.
