Some books provide the following loose definition of the Cantor distribution:
They start by defining the <TERM>Cantor set</TERM>  as <M>S = \cap_n S_n</M>.  Then the define the Cantor distribution as
 the uniform distribution on <M>S</M>.

While this does capture the spirit of the distribution, it is not a rigourous definition, because we have not defined "uniform
 distribution" only for finite sample spaces, and for distributions with densities. The Cantor distribution does not have
 PMF or density (shall show in the next section). So it is not clear what "uniform distribution" means here.
