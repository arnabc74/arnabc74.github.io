<HEAD1>Uncountable sample space</HEAD1>
We have already seen last semester that for an uncountable <M>\Omega</M>  we may not always be able
 to define a function <M>P:{\mathcal P}(\Omega)\to[0,1]</M> 
 satisfying all the probability axioms.  Please see <LINK to="../prob1_2024/vitali.html">this page
 from the last semester</LINK>  to brush up on this. 

Hence we defined <M>\sigma</M>-algebra. While the simplest <M>\sigma</M>-algebras are the trivial one and the entore power
 set, the most commonly used is the Borel <M>\sigma</M>-algebra. 

Closely related to this is the idea of a measurable function.
