      Your not-too-honest (and less-than-brilliant) boss has handed you a bivariate
      data set consisting of these 5 pairs of $$(xi,yi)$$  values:
      (1,2), (2,5), (3,7), (4,7), (5,9).
      He wants you fit a straight line to it, and then to deliberately introduce a fake point
      $$(3,y)$$ such that the slope increases by 0.1 (just so that his year-end
      report will look better). Choose the correct option.
