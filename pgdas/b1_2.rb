<HEAD1>Module 2: Presentation of data</HEAD1>

<HEAD2>Lesson 1, Video 1: Graphical: exploratory and pedagogic</HEAD2>
In the year 1958, a war took place between the British and the
Russian. A particularly infamous battle fought in it was the
battle of Crimea, where  a young nurse named Florence Nightingale, along with a
small group of friends,  was providing
voluntary service at the battlefield. She was shocked to find
that more soldiers died of disease than in actual
fighting. She saw this clearly, as did many others present at the
battlefield. But unfortunately the policy makers sitting in
London did not see this as clearly. Fortunately for the soldiers
and the posterity, Florence Nightingale was not just a dedicated
nurse. She was also a statistician at heart, one who knew how to
convince others using data. Data, as a dumb jumble of numbers,
were not appealing. She knew that. So she improvised a colourful
way to bring her point home. For each month she had the numbers
of deaths due to different causes. She gave a sector to each
month, and split the sector into a number of parts, one for each
cause. The resulting diagram is called Nighingale Rose Chart. It
indeed had so much impact on the policymakers that sanitary
condition of the soldiers improved considerably.

This example shows the power of pictures. We use our eyes to
decide about our surroundings. Graphical representation of data
allows our eyes to perform quick statistical analysis.

One may, like Florence Nightingale, improvise one's own way of
representing data graphically. But there are certain standard
methods, which every statistician should know about. 

<HEAD2>Lesson 1, Video 2: Line diagram</HEAD2>
The data used by Florence Nightingale are tim series data. The
most common way to depict such data is the <B>line chart</B>. 
This is just a graph with time shown in the <M>x</M>-axis, and
the quantity of interest in the <M>y</M>-axis. If our data set
looks like this <V>table shown</V>, then each row gives us a
point. We join them with piecewise straighlines to get a line
chart. 
If we multiple quantities of interest, then we vave multiple
lines that may be plotted separately or, to facilitate comarison,
overlaid on the same plot. For instance, Florence Nightingale
could have produced this plot to convey the same information as
her rose chart. However, notice that her plot highlighted her
contension that diseases were the greatest killer more
forcefully.  This is an importnt consideration when choosing one
graphical technique over another: which is
more <B>convincing</B>? Unfortunatley, it is easy to go
overboard, and produce plots that almost present a distorted
version of trth. We shall talk more abot this later.

<EXR>Make an overlaid line plot of the two variables.</EXR>

<HEAD2>Lesson 1, Video 3: Scatter plot</HEAD2>
Scatter plot is a close kin of the line chart. Here we just show
the points without joining them with lines. Consider a height
weight data set. Here each case is a point. Typically, the
variable which is less in our ontrol, and is more relieably
measured, is shown in the <M>x</M>-axis. If there are more than
two variables, then we can use a scatter plot matrix, sometimes
also called a pairs plot.
