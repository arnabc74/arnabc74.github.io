      We have a huge population possibly containing a few outliers.
      We want to estimate the population mean. We have two contending estimators
      sample mean ($$T_1$$) and sample 10% trimmed mean ($$T_2$$). Then
      which of the following should you expect to hold?
      
  shuffleOptions: true
  options:
  - answer: Standard error of $$T_1$$ should exceed that of $$T_2.$$
    isCorrect: true
      
  - answer: Standard error of $$T_2$$ should exceed that of $$T_1.$$
      
  - answer:  Standard error of $$T_1$$ should equal that of $$T_2.$$
      
  - answer: Nothing can be said in general.

      A huge population consists of people who are either for or against a certain political party.
      Let $$\theta$$ be the (unknown) proportion of persons favouring the party.
      A random sample of 100 people is drawn from the population. Each person in the
      sample is asked to roll  a fair die, and asked the question "Do you support the party?"
      If the die shows 1 or 2, the respondent is to answer truthfully, else they are required to lie.
      If exactly $$72$$ persons in the sample answer "Yes", then obtain an estimate of $$\theta$$
      following the technique outlined in class.

      Dot stereograms are a pair of pictures like these: If you stare at these for some time
      so that each eye sees only one picture, the two pictures fuse inside the brain after
      some time ($$T$$) and produce an illusion of a single 3D object. $$T$$ takes diferent
      values for diffeent people. Researchers suspect that $$T$$ is smaller if the person
      is told beforehand about the 3D object they are supposed to see. To test these 30 persons
      are grouped randomly into two groups. The persons in the first group are told beforehand
      about the 3D object, while those in the second group are not given this information.
      Then each person is shown the stereograms and asked to press a timer button the moment
      they start perceiving the 3D object. Which test should the researchers perform here?

      A dishonest (and not-too-bright) statistician
      has been appointed to test $$H_0:$$ men are smarter vs $$H_1:$$ men are not smarter.
      He has collected a radom sample of 10 men and 10 women, and asked them a riddle. But his secret 
      plan is not to use the data at all, but to toss a (possibly biased) coin, and accept $$H_0$$
      if and only if the coin shows head. Then which of the following is true about this test? 
      
  shuffleOptions: true
  options:
  - answer: $$P(type I)+P(type II) = 1$$
    isCorrect: true
      
  - answer:  $$P(type I)=P(type II)$$
      
  - answer:  $$P(type I) = p$$-value.
      
  - answer:  $$P(type I) =0.05.$$
