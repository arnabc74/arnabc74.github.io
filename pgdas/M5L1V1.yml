- typeName: multipleChoiceWe have a data set with just three cases. The value of the
variable for the first case is given. Find the values of the
other two to achieve 
the smallest possible dispersion. 

- typeName: multipleChoiceWrite down two sets of numbers such that the mean of the
first set is smaller,  but the dispersion is larger.
