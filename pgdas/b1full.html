<title>Course: Basic 1</title>
This course consists of 6 modules, each spanning one week. Each
module is made of 5 lessons, which in their turn are split into
2 (or in some cases 3) videos. Each of the first 4 lessons in a
module has around 5 formative quizzes. The last lesson is a
review lesson and has 8 summative quizzes, where 2 are taken from
each of the preceding lessons in that module. In this file I am
providing only the formative quizzes, as the summative ones are
essentially of the same type.

<h1><a
name="Module 1: Data types">Module 1: Data types</a></h1>


<h2><a
name="Lesson 1, Video 1: Data--what and why">Lesson 1, Video 1: Data--what and why</a></h2>
Hello, and welcome to the PGDAS course on basic statistics. This
is the first lecture in the very first module. Name enters.As you should know
already, the course consists of 6 modules, each of one week
duration, followed by 2 weeks of live online classes.Name leaves. This is
the very first lecture of module 1. 
<p></p>
We hear about statistics a lot. But what is it? Well, there are
various ways to define it. Possibly the simplest, and most
comprehensive way, is to say that <b>statistics</b> is the <b>science
of learning from experience</b>, and as such is the most fundamental 
tool behind human existence. Whether we are trying to predict 
tomorrow's weather, or the next wave of COVID, we are using
statistics.
<p></p>
 Most often we learn from experience even without
knowing it.  When we do something unconsciously, out of reflex,
without really thinking about it, we tend to do it
inefficiently. Take high jumping, for instance. Most of us can jump
over a fence. We hardly need to think about it. Our muscles
somehow move on their own and we end up on the other side. But if
one considers the process  consciously, one can see many subtle
ways of improvement, and the sum total of all those may lead to a
quite different technique and 
rather surprising improvement in efficiency!

<p></p>

Well, the same is true about learning from experience. 
Statistics is a conscious and careful way of going about
this. Let's start by carefully looking at the word
"<b>experience</b>". Let's take a simple example. Suppose we want to tap
the experience of our friends about some movie. If ask them
about what they think about it, we shall get responses like
"<b>Good</b>", "<b>so-so</b>", "<b>Ok</b>", "<b>Hey you must watch it</b>"! Yet another may
give you a long description about what she liked the
most. Blah blah Informative as such informal comments are, they are
difficult to summarise efficiently. One person's "Good" may very well be another
person's "so-so". Webpages like
Rotten Tomato does the same thing, but in a more systematic
way. They provide a 5-star rating, which provides a common
scale and provides a more uniform data than a mere haphazard
collection of "Good" and
"so-so". When we collect experience in such a systematic
way we get <b>data</b>. And this is the first point where
statistics differs from the common man's way of learning from
experience.  Statistics systematically collects and  stores the experience in a
cut-and-dried fashion before proceeding to glean information from
it. Data are  that cut-and-dried experience. 


<p></p>

The term data conjures up the vision of numbers...zillions of
figures stored in computer disks to be processed by gigantic
supercomputers. Well, while it is true to some extent, data need not
always be numbers. They may take other forms. In order to learn
statistics effectively, it is imperative that we know what data
are. 

<p></p>

And yes, "data" is a plural word. Its singular "datum" is rarely
used. A common mistake found in many reports is to say things
like "This data says ...". It should be either "These data say
..." or "This data set says ...". But knowing the word "data"
grammatically is not enough. We need to take a deeper look, and
that's what we are about to do next.

<h3><a
name="Exercises M1L1A">Exercises M1L1A</a></h3>

<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Which of the following is the best description of  "statistics"
as a subject?
<ol type="">

<li>Science of learning from experience.</li>

<li>Number crunching.</li>

<li>Prediction of future</li>

<li>Worse than damned lie!</li>

</ol>

<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
We want to collect first hand data about villagers' condition after a
natural calamity. Which is the best way to go about it?
<ol type="">

<li>Chat with the villagers informally</li>

<li>Prepare a list of questions before visiting the village, and
present that  list to each villager</li>

<li>Same as above but with questions prepared after an informal
chat with the villagers</li>

<li>Ask only the head of the village.</li>

</ol>

<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<h2><a
name="Lesson 1, Video 2: Data--types">Lesson 1, Video 2: Data--types</a></h2>
Before we start talking abou the details, let's take a quick look
at some different ways one may go about collecting data. When you
are collecting data, there is a scenario. Like a village, and you
plan to collect data on the agriculatural land holding. There are
basically two ways: you may actually measure the land yourself,
or get the information from the existing government records. In
the first first case, the data set is called <b>primary
data</b>. In the second it is <b>secondary data</b>. Thus,
primary data are what the agency has collected afresh for the
current purpose. Secondary data mean data that were collected
earlier (possibly by another agency for a different purpose).
<p></p>
There is another way to classify the data collection
procedure. If you are interested in the monthly expendicure of
the houselholds in a village and the village has just 30
houselholds, then you can indeed visit each and every houselhold
to collect the data. This is called <b>complete
enumertion</b>. But imagine doing the same thing for every
household in a large city! Then we have to resort to take
a <b>sample</b>, <b>a representative subset of all the households,</b>
and collect data from only those households. 
<p></p>
There is yet another way to classify data
collection. <b>Observational study</b> and <b>designed
experiment</b>.  In an observational study, you are merely a
passive observer, collecting information about a system as you
find it, without trying to modify the system. In a designed
experiment, by contrast, you are deliberately trying to disturb
the system, and collecting data about how it responds to the
change. Let me give a very simple mundane example. You see
something longish lying on the way. Is it a rope? Or a snake? You
want to find out. You may go about this in two ways: you way just
wait and watch it behaviour (that's observational study). Or you may just throw a stone at it,
and see how it reacts (that would be a designed experiment).

<p></p>
Well, that's quite a bit of jargon for a single video. Confusing
as they might see at first, these concepts are important ones
when yoy work with data. Each has its advantages and
disadvantages. Primary data, for example, are the only option if you are
conducting study about something not explored before. But they
also happen to be very expensive. Secondary data are easier to
get, but may be dated, or not exactly suited for a particular
study. The choice is somewhat like choosing a readymade dress or
a custommade dress. 
<p></p>

A comparison between complete enumeration and sampled data is
similar. Complete enumeration gives you, well, the complte
information. What can be better? But then it comes at a great
price. It is enormously more expensive and time
consuming. Indeed, so much so it might just be infeasible in many
cases. But samplined data have their own pain. Is the sample
really representative of the entire population? That's a question
that continues to bug all conclusons that you draw from such
data. 
<p></p>
Let's now compare observational study with designed
experiment. Most scientific studies that deal with causality ie,
tries to conclude things like "this causes that", must rely on
designed experiment. To conclude things like "This causes that",
you have to really do "this" and see if "that" occurs, and then
not do "this" and make sure that "that" also does not occur. In
other words, you have to modify the system according to a
design. As you might guess, this involves a lot of extra effort, 
not present in observational study. However, there are many
situations where observational study is the only way to go. To
check if smoking causes cancer, you cannot really ask a person to
start smoking! Most social science data are collected by
observational study.

<h2><a
name="Lesson 1, Video 3: Case, variable and rectangular structure">Lesson 1, Video 3: Case, variable and rectangular structure</a></h2>

All data are results of measurements. The measurement may be made
by a scientific instrument like a measuring tape or a therometer
or telescope, or simply by asking a verbal question, or merely by
inspection. Of course, judging a person's gender by merely looking
at the person hardly deserves to be called a measurement. So
statisticians prefer to use the term <b>variable</b>. The result
of each measurement gives a single outcome called
the <b>value</b>. 
<p></p>
When we make a measurement, we are are measuring <i>something</i>
or <i>somebody</i>. That something or somebody is called
a <b>case</b>. When you are recording a patient's body
temperature, the patient is a case, "temeperature"  is the
variable, and the number itself is the value of that variable for
that case. Typically, a statical data set consists of a number of
variables and a number of cases. The corresponding values are
laid out in a rectangular structure, where the rows denote the
cases and the columns denote the variables. All standard
statistical softwares excpect the data to be in this rectangular format.

<p></p>
Sometimes beginners fail to create this rectangular format. For
this, it helps to imagine a <b>report sheet</b> with fields like
"temperature" "patient's name" to be filled in. Everytime you
have a occasion to fill up a copy of this report sheet, you get a
case. Each field in the sheet is a variable, and everything you
write while filling it up is a value.

<h2><a
name="Lesson 2, Video 1: Continuous, discrete, counting and categorical">Lesson 2, Video 1: Continuous, discrete, counting and categorical</a></h2>

Different variables 
 may be of different types. Some may be numbers, others may be
 like names. All values belonging to the same variable must be of
 the same type.  Thus, if we have a variable like a person's
 height, then either all of the values are in numbers (<i>e.g.</i>, in
 cm) or in words  like "tall", "medium" and "short". But not a
 mixture of both.  

The simplest type of variable is an <b>identifier</b> variable. These
are used to identify something. They could be names or roll
numbers or EPIC or PAN or something similar.

<p></p>

Another simple type is a <b>timestemp</b> variable. 
<p></p>


Contrast this with another scenario. Suppose that we are visiting
a village and asking each family about the number of children
they have. There the data may be like this. Some family has 2
children, some have 3, while others may have 4 or none. Can a
family have 2.5 children? No! Thus, here the
values in-between are not valid. The possible values stand apart
with some gaps between them. 
 This is a <b>counting</b> variable. Examples of other variables of
this type include <b>count of trees in an area</b>, 
<b>number of COVID infections in a district</b>. 

<p></p>

A different type of variable
is <b>gender</b>, which typically takes
three values <b>Male</b>, <b>Female</b> and <b>Others</b>.
Unlike the counting variables, here we know exactly all the
possible values. This is what is called a <b>categorical</b>
variable. 

<p></p>


A fourth type of variable may be called the <b>interval</b>
type. Examples are like income group or age group. These are
basically low resolution versions of continuous variables. The
range of values of a continuous variable is split into a number
of adjacent intervals, and only the interval in which a number
falls is recorded. Like for age, we could have the age groups
20--40, 45--60, above 60. Here we need to be careful about the
boundary values. Usually, names are associated with each
interval, <i>e.g.</i>, Young, Middleage and Senior. Similarly, for LIG,
MIG and HIG for income. 

<p></p>


A fifth type is called a <b>Likert scale</b> variable.

<p></p>

<b>Numerical measurements</b> constitute the most important type
of variable. Examples include temperature, blood pressure, area
of plots, yield of plots.

<h2><a

One might easily get confsed with so many different types of
variables! To ease the pain, statiticians have reduced the number
to just four
<ul>

<li>COntinuous:
<ul>

<li>Difference type</li>

<li>Ratio type</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Discrete
<ul>

<li>
<b>Nominal</b>
</li>

<li>
<b>Ordinal</b>
</li>

<li>
<b>Counting</b>
</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>
we split all such measurements into two types: <b>continuous</b>
and <b>discrete</b>. Continuous means a measurement that takes
values in a continuum, a range of values without any gap. Like a
measuring people's heights. When you measure heights of a bunch
of people you will get a few numbers like these. While these are
only some distinct points along the number line, the points
between them are also valid values. It is not that people either
have this height or they jump to that height without ever taking
the values in-between. All possible human heights form a
continuum, a range without any gap. So height is a continuous
variable. 

<p></p>


Some variables are clearly not continuous, like gender. However,
for some others the distinction is less prominent. Take for
example area of agricultural plots. One would typically measure
it up to the nearest square metre. So the values are all
integers. While area is definitely continuous, the "reported
area" is obviously like a counting variable! However, here we
still consider it continuous. This decision is based on two
considerations: 
<ul>

<li>First, "area" itself is continuous.</li>

<li>Second, one square metre is much too small compared to the
total area.</li>

</ul>
The same idea applies to any measurement. All measurements are
made by finite precision instruments, and hence can take only
finitely many values. Yet we consider the measurement to be
continuous if the resolution is sufficiently high.

<h2><a
name="Lesson 4, Video 1: File formats: Excel">Lesson 4, Video 1: File formats: Excel</a></h2>


In olden days people used to store data on paper. Now computer
disks provide the main storage. Data sets are stored as files,
be it in the hard drive of a computer or removable devices like a
USB drive. A file in a computer is just a collection of 0's and
1's. When we store data  in a file, they first need to be
converted into 0's and 1's. When we read the data back from the
file, the 0's and 1's are converted back into the original
form. This two-way conversion process is mostly done
automatically without our intervention. Now, this process may be
done in different ways, and each such way is called a <b>file
format</b>. 
There are quite a few file formats that are used in
statistics. Some are free, while others are propreitary and
require paid softwares to write or read. Some formats are good
for sending data files over the email, while some formats are
optimised to hold a large amount of data in a small space. 


<p></p>

In this course we shall use the MS Excel software, which
understands various file formats. We shall discuss only two of
them. Every file format has its specific file name extension. The
first format has the extension <b>.xlsx</b>. This is the default
file format used by MS Excel.

<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;Insert a row. Then insert a column.<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<h2><a
name="Lesson 4, Video 2: File formats: CSV">Lesson 4, Video 2: File formats: CSV</a></h2>
While the Excel format is adequate for many elementary
purposes, there are a couple of drawbacks. First, you need to
have MS Excel in order to view the data in the file, or even to
make minor modifications. Second, the file may be easily
corrupted if you send it by email. Third, in case you want to
process the data by some other software, this format may not be
recognised by that software. So it is a good idea to know about a
universally understood format, called
the <b>comma-separated-values</b> format, with file
extension <b>.csv</b>. In this format each case is represented by
a line and the values in each line are separated by a comma. This
format is particularly useful when a value may have a space in
it, <i>e.g.</i> <b>West Bengal</b> or <b>Ram Singh</b>. Sometimes a
value may be missing. Such missing values may be easily marked by
two consecutive commas. 
<p></p>
On most computers a file with <b>.csv</b> format is automatically
opened in MS Excel, if the software in installed. However, the
CSV format has one downside. It cannot hold anything other than
a single data table, while the XLSX format can hold multiple
tables, as well as graphs and reports.

<h2><a
name="Lesson 1, Video 1: Graphical: exploratory and pedagogic">Lesson 1, Video 1: Graphical: exploratory and pedagogic</a></h2>
In the year 1958, a war took place between the British and the
Russian. A particularly infamous battle fought in it was the
battle of Crimea, where  a young nurse named Florence Nightingale, along with a
small group of friends,  was providing
voluntary service at the battlefield. She was shocked to find
that more soldiers died of disease than in actual
fighting. She saw this clearly, as did many others present at the
battlefield. But unfortunately the policy makers sitting in
London did not see this as clearly. Fortunately for the soldiers
and the posterity, Florence Nightingale was not just a dedicated
nurse. She was also a statistician at heart, one who knew how to
convince others using data. Data, as a dumb jumble of numbers,
were not appealing. She knew that. So she improvised a colourful
way to bring her point home. For each month she had the numbers
of deaths due to different causes. She gave a sector to each
month, and split the sector into a number of parts, one for each
cause. The resulting diagram is called Nighingale Rose Chart. It
indeed had so much impact on the policymakers that sanitary
condition of the soldiers improved considerably. 
<p></p>
This example shows the power of pictures. We use our eyes to
decide about our surroundings. Graphical representation of data
allows our eyes to perform quick statistical analysis. 
<p></p>
One may, like Florence Nightingale, improvise one's own way of
representing data graphically. But there are certain standard
methods, which every statistician should know about. 

<h2><a
name="Lesson 1, Video 2: Line diagram">Lesson 1, Video 2: Line diagram</a></h2>
The data used by Florence Nightingale are tim series data. The
most common way to depict such data is the <b>line chart</b>. 
This is just a graph with time shown in the $x$-axis, and
the quantity of interest in the $y$-axis. If our data set
looks like this table shown, then each row gives us a
point. We join them with piecewise straighlines to get a line
chart. 
If we multiple quantities of interest, then we vave multiple
lines that may be plotted separately or, to facilitate comarison,
overlaid on the same plot. For instance, Florence Nightingale
could have produced this plot to convey the same information as
her rose chart. However, notice that her plot highlighted her
contension that diseases were the greatest killer more
forcefully.  This is an importnt consideration when choosing one
graphical technique over another: which is
more <b>convincing</b>? Unfortunatley, it is easy to go
overboard, and produce plots that almost present a distorted
version of trth. We shall talk more abot this later.

Scatter plot is a close kin of the line chart. Here we just show
the points without joining them with lines. Consider a height
weight data set. Here each case is a point. Typically, the
variable which is less in our ontrol, and is more relieably
measured, is shown in the $x$-axis. If there are more than
two variables, then we can use a scatter plot matrix, sometimes
also called a pairs plot.

Let me ask you a simple question: <b>what is the average life span
of Indians?</b> You may not know the exact answer, but you'll guess
that it is around 70. Now let me ask you another question: <b>what
is the average body weight of an adult male dolphin?</b> Possibly you
have no idea, and may turn to Google for an answer. Now comes the
last question: <b>what is the average weight of a mammal?</b> I am sure
you do not know! I am sure you've never heard this question
before. Will you turn to Google for an answer? No, this question
is absurd! There are so many different types of mammals ranging
from tiny rodents to enormous blue whales. What do you mean by
"average" here? Well, we learned in school
