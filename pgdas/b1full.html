Hello,  and welcome to the PGDAS course on Basic Statistics. This
is our very first lecture, and I am your
instructor. Name enters. First let me tell you something
about the structure of our course.


The course consists of 6 modules,  each of one week
duration,  followed by 2 weeks during which you get to study on your
own (digesting all the pieces of information I bombard at you)
and within the same 2 two weeks you also appear for a final
exam. And that brings us to the important question: How are
you going to be graded?

Grading


Each week we shall discuss four topics, and these will be
followed by practice
problems. The points from these will not be considered for final
grading.

The week's grade will come from a unit test at the end
of the week. It will consist of 8 exercies
(2 taken from each of the 4 topics learned in the week). The
marks you get here will be added to your marks from the final exam.


 Well,
that's about it! Now let's get started with the lessons.

This course consists of 6 modules,  each spanning one week. Each
module is made of 5 lessons,  which in their turn are split into
2 (or in some cases 3) videos. Each of the first 4 lessons in a
module has around 5 formative quizzes. The last lesson is a
review lesson and has 8 summative quizzes,  where 2 are taken from
each of the preceding lessons in that module. In this file I am
providing only the formative quizzes,  as the summative ones are
essentially of the same type.

Hello,  and welcome to the PGDAS course on <b>Basic Statistics</b>. This

about the structure of our course.

 Well,
that's about it! Now let's get started with the lessons.

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.2</i></legend>
This is a course on <b>Basic Statistics</b>.
We hear about <b>statistics</b> a lot. But what is it? Well,  there are
various ways to define it.
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend class="cu"><i>Duration=0.5</i></legend> Possibly the simplest,  and the most
comprehensive way,  is to say that is is the <b>art and science
of learning from experience</b>,  and as such is the most fundamental 
tool behind human existence. Whether we are trying to predict 
tomorrow's weather <b><font color="red">
[Google weather icons] </font></b>,  or the next wave
of COVID <b><font color="red">
[A plot] </font></b>,  we are using
statistics.
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.8</i></legend>
 Most often we learn from experience even without
knowing it.  When we do something unconsciously,  out of reflex, 
without really thinking about it,  we tend to do it
inefficiently. Take high jumping,  for instance. Most of us can jump
over a fence. <b><font color="red">
[Jump] </font></b> We hardly need to think about it. Our muscles
somehow move on their own and we end up on the other side. But if
one considers the process  consciously,  one can see many subtle
ways of improvement,  and the sum total of all those may lead to a
quite different technique <b><font color="red">
[fosbury flop glides past] </font></b> and 
a rather substantial  improvement in efficiency!
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.3</i></legend>

Well,  the same is true about learning from experience. 
Statistics is a conscious and careful way of going about
this. Let's start by carefully looking at the word
"<b>experience</b>". Let's take a simple example. Suppose we want to tap
the experience of our friends about some movie. If we ask them
about what they think about it, we shall get responses like
"<b>Good</b>",  "<b>so-so</b>",  "<b>Ok</b>",  "<b>Hey you must watch it</b>"! Yet another may
give you a long description about what she liked the
most. <b><font color="red">
[Blah blah] </font></b> Informative as such informal comments are,  they are
difficult to summarise efficiently. For one thing, they lack a common scale. One person's "Good" may very well be another
person's "so-so". The very first thing we might do to rectify
this is consciously provide a common scale. <b><font color="red">
[Likert scale
appears.] </font></b> Webpages like
Rotten Tomato does precisely this. They provide a 5-star rating.  This common
scale brings more uniformity in the responses than a mere haphazard
collection of "Good" and
"so-so".
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Data</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.6</i></legend>
 When we collect experience in such a systematic
way we get <b>data</b>. And this is the first point where
statistics differs from the common man's way of learning from
experience.  Statistics systematically collects and  stores the experience in a
cut-and-dried fashion before proceeding to glean information from
it. Data are  that cut-and-dried experience.
<p></p>
It might interest you to learn about the different ways data are
collected. So let's get a taste of that before delving deeper. 
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Data collection devices</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.00</i></legend>
There are basically five types of devices for data collection
depending on the scenario. 
Measure, Observe, Lookup, Ask, and Derive. If we want data about some
physical quantity that is accessible to us, like the area of
land, height of a person, intensity of sound, temperature of a
green house, the most direct way is to just measure it.
Sometimes, however, merely observing is enough, for instance, a
person's gender. In many cases, especially for data of social
importance, we may get them from records. For instance, income amounts
for employees may be obtained from pay registers. In some
situations asking a knowledgeable person is the only way to get
information. This is particularly true if the information is
about a mental state (like satisfaction level, or
smartness). Finally, certain data are obtained directly by are derived from
other related quantities. Examples include total expenditure or a
student's marks.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Looking at data</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.00</i></legend>
Statisticians have to work with data just chemists have to work
with chemicals. When you see a data set for the first time, it is
like entering an unknown dark room. Your eyes will need time to
adjust to it. Similarly, one needs some time to understand what
a data set is about. A good mental exercise to facilitate this
process is to quickly classify the various pieces of information
present in the data set in terms of how they were
collected. Let's consider this: the number of female headed rural
households having 4 rooms in
West Bengal's Malda district. Let's think for a moment how this
number was arrived at. It involved measurement in the form of
counting, involved asking (how many rooms are there in the
house?). But how was the "female headed" attribute decided? Was
it the result of asking? Or is it based on some government record
backed by a precise definition? Thinking about such points may
appear unnecessary, but is a good way to warm up.
<p></p>
This excercise is not only good for warming up, but may throw
light on the reliability of the information present. For
instance, if you ask a person about his/her monthly income data,
you are more likely to get an underestimate. However, if the data
were obtained from his pay slip, then the amount is
accurate.

Ah yes,  "data" is a plural word. Its singular "datum" is rarely
used. A common mistake found in many reports is to say things
like "This data says ...". It should be either "These data say
..." or "This data set says ...". But knowing the word "data"
grammatically is not enough. We need to take a deeper look,  and
that's what we are about to do next.

In the last video we learned about the various instruments to get
data. These instruments may be used in different ways in a
real scenario. In this video we shall take a look at some of these. 
First, a few terms:

In any data collection scenario we have an
<b>agency</b> that collects the data. It could be the government, a
private organisation, or even an investigator in invididual
capacity. Then there is a <b>scope</b>. For example, the agency
may be interested in only rural households having income from
agriculture, or it could be only urban household with at least
one earning female member. The scope also specifies the <b>time
frame</b>. Jst imagine how meaningless it would be to refer to
census data without mentioning the year of the census! Finally,
we have the concept of a <b>unit</b>. If you are colelcting data
about households, then each household is a unit, if you are
collecting data about districts, then each distrct is a unit. 
<p></p>
Multiple agencies may be responsible for various parts of a data
set. For instance, an agency may take the data from some
existing record, created by some other agency in the past. Such 
data are called <b>secondary data</b>. If the agency reporting
the data is also responsible for collecting the data, then we
have <b>primary data</b>.
<p></p>
Whether to use primary or secondary data is an important decision
that one has to make right at the outset.
Each has its advantages and
disadvantages. Primary data,  for example,  are the only option if you are
conducting study about something not explored before. But they
also happen to be very expensive. Secondary data are easier to
get,  but may be dated,  or not exactly suited for a particular
study.
<p></p>
It is somewhat like buying a dress. You may buy a custom-made
dress to suit your exact requirements, or you may just buy a
ready-made one. The advantages and disadvantages are
similar. Primary data is more expensive and time-consuming to
collect, but if you can manage to get them, they will give you
the exact information you want. Secondary data, on the other
hand, are , if  available, easier to get, but may only be an
approximation to the information that you are actually seeking.

We have talked about the <b>scope</b> of a data, and also
mentioned the concept of <b>units</b>. All the units coming under
the scope constitute the <b>population</b>. For example, if we
are dealing with household level rural data for a district, then
the set of all rural households in the district is the
population. If the population is small, then you can actually
collect the data from each and every unit. This is called <b>complete
enumertion</b>.
As an example,  if you are interested in the monthly expenditure of
the houselholds in a village and the village has just 30
households,  then you can indeed visit each and every household
to collect the data.  But imagine doing the same thing for every
household in a large city! Then we have to resort to take
a <b>sample</b>,  <b>a representative subset of all the households, </b>
and collect data from only those households. 
<p></p>
How to choose the sample appropriately is a vast topic in
itself. You'll learn more about it later in the course Sample
Survey. For now, let it suffice to know that most of the time we
select the sample as a random subset of the population. Such a
sample is naturally called a <b>random sample</b>. 

<p></p>
How to compare between complete enumeration data and data
obtained from a sample?
Complete enumeration gives,  well,  the complte
information. What can be better? But then it comes at a great
price. It is enormously more expensive and time
consuming. Indeed,  so much so it might just be infeasible in many
cases. Even a country can hardly afford to perform complete
census frequently. But sampling is almost inevtiablle in most
situations. But samples have their own pain. Is a sample
really representative of the entire population? That's a question
that continues to bug all conclusons that you draw from such
data. The larger the sample size, the greater chance that it will
explore the nooks and corners of the population. But larger
sample size means greater expense in data collection as
well. Balancing that trade-off is an important cosideration in
sample survey, as you will learn later.

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=2.70</i></legend>
There is yet another way to classify data
collection. <b>Observational study</b> and <b>designed
experiment</b>.  In an observational study,  you are merely a
passive observer,  collecting information about a system as you
find it,  without trying to modify the system. In a designed
experiment,  by contrast,  you are deliberately trying to disturb
the system,  and collecting data about how it responds to the
change. Let me give a very simple mundane example. You see
something like a rope lying on the way. Is it really a rope? Or a snake? You
want to find out. You may go about this in two ways: you way just
wait and watch its behaviour (that's observational study). If it
stays in the same posture for 10 minutes, then possibly it is
just a piece of rope. But if it starts slithering away, then
definitely it is a snake. Here is an alternative way of going
about this:  you  throw a stone at it, 
and see how it reacts. This would be a designed experiment,
because you deliberately chnged the system in order to learn how
the system reacts to the change.
<p></p>
Designed experiments are used more frequently in clinical
trials to assess effectiveness of drugs, or deciding about optimal
settings in a production process. In a social study, on the other
hand, we generally cannot or do want to disturb the system, and
hence have to rely on observational study. If we want to relate
educational level to income, then observational study od the only
way to go about it. 
<p></p>
Let's now compare observational study with designed
experiment. Most scientific studies that deal with causality ie, 
tries to conclude things like "this causes that",  must rely on
designed experiment. To conclude things like "This causes that", 
you have to really do "this" and see if "that" occurs,  and then
not do "this" and make sure that "that" also does not occur. In
other words,  you have to modify the system according to a
design. As you might guess,  this involves a lot of extra effort,  
not present in observational study. However,  there are many
situations where observational study is the only way to go. To
check if smoking causes cancer,  you cannot really ask a person to
start smoking! Most social science data are collected by
observational study.

The term data conjures up the vision of numbers...zillions of
figures stored in computer disks to be processed by gigantic
supercomputers. Well,  it is true to some extent,  all data
are encoded as numbers when stored in computers, but the data
themselves need not
always be numbers. They may take other forms. In order to learn
statistics effectively,  it is imperative that we know how data set
looks inside a computer. It looks like a rectangle, what is
called a data matrix.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Data matrix</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.30</i></legend>
Let's start with an example. Here is a data set stored shown in a
spreadsheet. It is like rectangle, consisting of a number of rows
and columns. Each column denotes a <b>variable</b>. 
Each row is called a <b>case</b>. Think of this like this. We had
already mentioned about units in a data collection scenario,
remember? Like the households in a household-level survey. When
we collect data we get information about the households. Like
making a measurement, or asking a specific questionm making an
observation. Each measurement or question or
observation gives rise to a variable. Like "What is the family
size?" corresponds to one variable. The responses that we get
for measurement / question / observation are the  <b>value</b>s
for that variable. All the values corresponding to the same unit
are customarily written in a row, or case, as we call it. The
values for the same variable are written in a same column. This
is the format that all standard softwares expect the data to be in.
<p></p>
Sometimes beginners fail to cast a data set into this
rectangular format. Let's discuss this next.
 </fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">From data to data matrix</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.40</i></legend>
We have already seen how the values in a data set result from
five different sources: measuring,  observing, looking up, asking
and deriving. But when we want to cast the data into a data
matrix, it helps to imagine a <b>report sheet</b> where each
variable is like a field. Imagine that you are approaching each
unit with a copy of this sheet, and filling it up based on the
information from that unit. Then each filled-in sheet gives you
one case (i.e, row) of your data matrix.
<p></p>
An example might help here. 
Suppose that we have are considering household level data in
different areas in a 
district. An area may be of one of three types: urban, semi-urban
and rural.  For each household we are interested in the number of
inmates, monthly income, whether the household owns agricultural
land, and if so the area of land holding. The hypothetical report
sheet will then have fields: 
  name of head (or some other identifier)
  name of area
  type of area
  number of inmates
  monthly income
  landholding [y/n]
  area  
Two points are in order here. First, the type of area is really
not an attribute of the household, rather it is  an attribute of
the area. But still I have put it in the report sheet. This is
quite common in practice. The information may actually come from
units of different levels nested inside one another, like here
household is the basic unit, that is inside the larger unit
called area. The type attribute is actually for the larger unit. 
But still, since each case in the data matrix refers to a single
household, I have included it in the report sheet.
<p></p>
 The second point is that the area of landholding is meaningful
only for the households owning land. But even for households without any
land holding, there must be a value for the area. It could be 0,
or could be some special marker like NA, or may simply be left
blank. 
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=2.00</i></legend>
Spreadsheet programs like MS-Excel or LibreOffice are used to
record data. However, sometimes one needs to rearrange the data
before it is ready for statistical analysis. Most, if not all,
statistical analysis requires the input to be a <i>single</i>
data matrix. But the data may be present over multiple tables in
a spreadsheet. Here are two scenarios. There may be units nested
inside one another. Like households inside villages, and villages
inside districts.
Some information may be available for districts, some for
villages, while someothers from vilages. It is important to merge
these into a single data matrix.

<p></p>
Another scenario is when different tables are created for
different larger units. Like we are collecting data for
agricultral plots in different villages. For each plot we want
its area, type of fertiliser and total yield. If there are 4
villages, with 10 plots in each, and one investigator is in
charge of collecting data from one village, then the collected
data will be in 4 tables, which need to be merged into a single
data matrix. Notice how the plot numbers are now repeated. 
Notice also how the names of villages came down from the
headings and formed a column of its own. This is an important
thing to remember. In the final data matrix, the information
should in the columns headings and the body. No information
should be in the table title. Similarly, there should not be any
info in the row headings. Here is an example. 

           Plot number 
District 1    1
              2
              3
District 2    1
              2
              3
              4
Here is a quick checklist:

   * No nested rows/columns. 
   * No row heading
   * No info in table heading
   * Single table
   * Rows denotes cases
   * Columns denote variables.

In the last lesson we have learned about types of data, and have
acquired a basic understanding of how they are collected. We
learned about cases and variables. Now it is time to take a
closer look at variables.
<p></p>
Variables are to statisticians what  colours are to a
painter. You may look at colours from the viewers' perspective,
and talk about dreamy sunset colour, or the warm colour of roses. But
all this wide variation is basically made by mixing colours in a
restricted pallete. So from the painter's perspective the colours
are more prosaically named as burnt sienna and carmine. The
description of the colours from the viewers' perspective are more
intuitive and often lack clear distincttion. But the painter's
terminology is more precise and technically oriented. 
<p></p>
Similar is the case with variables. We can classify them in terms
of usage, and also in terms of their techical nature. Let's learn
about them one by one.

 As we
already know the columns in a data matrix denote variables. The names of the
variables are given at the very top. A quick look at the values
show that some of them are numbers, while  others are
textual. Some values may be dates. Also some values may be
missing. Some values may be like "&lt;12" or "negligible". 
The first point to know is that all values belonging to the same
variable (<i>i.e.</i>, in the same column) must be of
 the same type.  Thus,  if we have a variable like a person's
 height,  then either all of the values are in numbers (<i>e.g.</i>,  in
 cm) or in words  like "tall",  "medium" and "short". But not a
 mixture of both.

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.9</i></legend>
Let's look at  an example. Here is a data  matrix.
The simplest type of variable from the users' perspective is an <b>identifier</b> variable. These
are, well,  used to identify a case. Most official statistics
data have quite a few of the initial columns devoted to
identifier variables. They could be names or roll
numbers or EPIC or PAN or something similar. These variables
rarely enter into any analysis. The major use for these is for
tracking. If there is something unusual about a case (as detected
before or after analysis), we may need to refer to it later. The
identifier vriables help us to do that. They are often used to
label plots. But more of that when we shall learn about plotting
data. 
<p></p>
I had once heard the story of a doctor who had a just a
smattering of the statistical knowledge. He wanted to study
various medical conditions of patients in a hospital. The data
matrix was full of numbers. The numbers in very first column gave
the bed numbers. In his confusion, he entered that into his
computation, and ended up with a numerical relation between blood
pressure and bed number! 
<p></p>
Don't do that mistake. 
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Timestamp</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.80</i></legend>
Another type of variable is a <b>timestamp</b>. This marks
the time when the that particular case was recorded. The time
stamp may be a date, or a month or even year. For a medical
monitoring data it may even be marked in hours and minutes. For
some cases the time stamp may be used only for identification
purpose. But for certain data sets, the time may enter the main
analysis. These are called <b>time series</b>. Examples are stock
prices recorded over time, number of COVID infected persons
recorded over time. Time series data are extremely important in
statistics, as they are used for predicting the future. We shall
later have more occasion to discuss time series. 
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Counting variables</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.7</i></legend>
Consider this scenario. We are visiting
a village and asking each family about the number of children
they have. There the data may be like this. One family may have 2
children,  another may have 3,  while others may have 4 or none. Can a
family have 2.5 children? No! Neither can a family have -2
children! Thus, here the values must be
non-negative integers. 
 This is an example of a <b>counting</b> variable. Examples of other variables of
this type include <b>count of trees in an area</b>,  
<b>number of COVID infections in a district</b>. 
<p></p>
Next we shall take a look a another type of variable.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Categorical variables</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.60</i></legend>
Let's look at this example. Here we have two types of houses:
Kuccha (<i>i.e.</i>, made of mud) and Pukka (made of concrete). 
Unlike the counting variables,  here we know exactly that these
are the only 
possible values. This is what is called a <b>categorical</b>
variable, because it denotes categories. Each value is the name
of a category.

<p></p>
Next we shall learn about variables that denote outcomes of measurements.
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=2.30</i></legend>
An important type of variables is measurement variables. As the
name suggests, these are
outcomes of measurements. If you are interested in the relation
between weight and height of different persons, then you'll
typically work with the data set like this. Here the variables
weight and height are both measurement variables.
<p></p>
Other example include temperature,  blood pressure,  area
of plots,  agricultural yield of plots. 

<p></p>

Now counting may be also considered as a form of measurement, but
we we shall use the term measurement variable for situations
where the quantity being meaaured is continuous. Unlike counting,
where a count jumps from one integer to the next, here the
measurements can take all the values inbetween. If it is possible
to have persons 5 feet and 6 feet tall, then it is possible to
have a person with any height between 5 and 6 feet. Of course the
sample at hand may not include such a peron, but it is ridiculous
to say that 5.2 feet is an impossible height for a person to have.
<p></p>
An important concept connected with such measrement variables is
that of <b>approximation</b>. All measurements made by hman
beings are done using finite precision instruments. For instance,
when you measure a persons height and say that she is 5 feet 3 in
tall, you are most probably reporting the height <i>to the
neaest inch</i>. As a result, the reported height jumps from one
integer mark to the next, much like a counting variable. But
note the difference. For counting, a count of 2.5 is impossible
in principle, while a height of 5 feet 2.3 inches is quite
possible. It is the inadequacy of the measuring instrument which
prevents us from reporting the height to that level of precision.
<p></p>
Sometimes we use approximation to such a crude level, that the
reported values hardly deserve to be called measurements. Instead
we get <b>interval variables</b>, which we discuss next.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Interval variables</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=2.40</i></legend>
We shall start with an example: income tax. Income tax depends on
income. So it is only natural that the data that the income tax
office is interested in, should have a variable called
income. Now income has a lot of variability. There are major
differences as well as minor differences. The major differences
are of course important, but are the minor differences of any
consequance for the computation of income tax? No. So the income
tax office considers income as income slabs. Something like up to
100,000, from 100,000 to 200,000, from 200,000 to 300,000, and so
on. These income slabs constitute a new variable, which is an
example of an interval variable. Sometimes the intervals are
given descriptive names like low income group, middle income
group, high income group, etc. Thus, income group like other
interval variables, is actually a
categorical variable. The difference between these and
categorical variables like gender lies in the fact that these are
created by grouping values of the underlying variable.
<p></p>
Other examples of such variables include letter grades in
examinations. Here A denotes a certain range of marks, B denotes
another range and so on.
<p></p>
Yet another example is age group.
<p></p>
When we use  an interval variables instead of the underlying raw
variable, we are obviously losing information. If I tell you that
my age is 47 years, you immediately know that I belong to the age
group middle age (say 40-50). But if I just tell you that I
belong to the middle age group, yo have no way of knowing my
exact age for sure. So why should we use interval variables
instead of the underlying raw variable?  Well, the main advantage 
is when the underlying variable cannot be
precisely  measured, and we really do not need the precision for
our present purpose. 

<p></p>
This idea of categorizing an underlying continuous measureument
variable is very commonly seen psychomtric studies and feedback
systems in the form of what is <b>Likert scales.</b> We discuss
this next.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Likert variables</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.10</i></legend>
In this age of online shopping we all know about Amazon and
Netflix and Rotten Tomato. All these sites allow the users to
provide ratings. These ratings are commonly given in a scale of 5
stars. This is an example of a <b>Likert scale</b>, or 5-point
Likert scale, to be precise.
<p></p>
This is also an interval variable in disguise, where the
underlying variable may be called satisfaction. But it is really
hard to measure it. So we cannot really explicitly associate
intervals to each rating, like "two star means satisfaction
between 2.3 and 4.6". That is why we refrain from the calling
them interval variables.
<p></p>
Well we have described many different types of variables from the
user's perspective. It is important to know these well, as the
choice of the appropriate type of statistical analyses depends
crucially on the type of variable you are working with.

In one of the earlier videos we mentioned how variables are some
what like coulours to a painter. There seem to be so many
different colours in the world. Yet to the painter everything
boils down to a surprising simple pallette consisting of only a
few colours. Similarly, from a technical perspective there are
only two different types of variables. Yes, you have heard that
right, just two: <b>continuous</b>
and <b>discrete</b>. 
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Continuous</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.20</i></legend>
Continuous means a measurement that takes
values in a continuum,  a range of values without any gap. We
have already seen this when we talked about 
measuring people's heights. When you measure heights of a bunch
of people you will get a few numbers like these. While these are
only some distinct points along the number line,  the points
between them are also valid values. It is not that people either
have this height or they jump to that height without ever taking
the values in-between. All possible human heights form a
continuum,  a range without any gap. So height is a continuous
variable. 
<p></p>
Most measurement variables are continuous. Here we are not taking
approximation into account, we are talking about the true
underlying value. It is quite possible that you are reporting the
figures rounted of to one decimal place, so no value between
150.3 and 150.4 can appear in the reported data, but actually the
value 150.32 is quite possible. It just gets reported as 150.3,
that's all! 
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Discrete</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.30</i></legend>To understand easily remember a discrete variable as one which
can take only finitely many values.
All the categorical variables are of this type. For instance,
gender can take only three values Male, Female and
others. Counting variables are also considered discrete, though
they can in principle go on and on. All identifier variables are
discrete, as well. So are Likert type variables. Variables whose
values use numbers  at
nominal or ordinal levels are all discrete. As you can
understand, almost all variables execept measurement variables are
discrete. The mathematics to handle all discrete variables is
quite similar. But that is no comfort for the practising
statistician, because the intepretation of the result will
crucially depend on whether a variable is Likert variable or a
Categorical variable. 

<p></p>
By the way, even a measurement variable may appear discrete due
to approximation. However, discrete or continuous refers to the
true values, and not the approximate values. Thus, even if
monthly income is reported to the nearest thousand, it is
considered continuous. However, if we use only income slabs,
which is a interval variable, then we have a discrete variable.

When we think about data, we think about numbers. While we do
occasionally use texts as values of variables, numbers are used
much more often. Now, numbers as used in a data set need not be
same as numbers as we learn in mathematics. Numbers are often
used as codes. Here's an
example. Suppose we hae a variable called <b>smoking
habit</b>. It can either be "yes" or "no". However, often such
binary values are encoded as 1 and 0, respectively. Now you must
be careful when working with these. You may not just average a
smoker and a non-smoker to get 0.5! That would just be
meaningless! Similarly, we cannot say that a smoker is greater
than a non-smoker (even though 1 is indeed greater than
0). Indeed, the numbers are just used as names here. Depending on
how they are used, there are 4 types of numbers in statistics:
  * nominal
  * ordinal
  * interval type
  * interval/ratio type
Let's start with nominal.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Nominal</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.10</i></legend>
When a number is used just as a name, we call it nominal. The
example of smoking habit that we saw just now furnishes one such
scenario. Another example could be coding Male as 0 and Female as
0. When a number is used nominally, we may not perform any
arithmetic operation or comparison with them. Changing the
numbers should also not have any effect, as long as the distinct
numbers remain distinct. Thus, we could as well have coded Male
as 2 and Female as 1. 
<p></p>
Numbers used nominally are a trap for the beginning
statisticians. They inadvertanently pass these numbers into
statistical analysis techniques that perform artihmetic
operations on them. The computer would never complain if you make
this mistake. You'll just be rewarded with garbage results. 
<p></p>
Next we shall talk about another level of using numbers, where
comparison is allowed, though arithmetic operations are still forbidden.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Ordinal</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.10</i></legend>
Consider a variable called educational level. This is an important
variable in many social studies. Typical values may be
"Preschool", "Primary", "Secondary", "Higher secondary",
"College" and "Higher". These may be encoded as numbers, say as
1,2,...,6, respectively. While this encoding is natural, would
you consider encoding them like this: 1 for "Preschool", 4 for
"Primary", 2 for "Higher", etc? No, that is absurd, because there
is an implied ordering among the values. Thus we are at a higher
level than nominal, but still arithmetic oprations are
meaningless. For example, 2-1 = 5-4, but that does not mean  that
the difference between 
primary education  and preschool education is the same as the
difference between
College than Higher secondary education. Indeed, we can hardly
quantify the "difference between primary and preschool education
levels"!
Earlier we talked about interval variables. If the intervals are
encoded as single numbers, then those numbers are being used as
ordinals. 
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Interval/ratio level</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.00</i></legend>
Next we shall talk about the highest level of using numbers. The
fancy name is <b>interval/ratio level</b>. In plain words, it
means using numbers as in mathematics. You can perform arithmetic
operation on these meaningfully. Most measurement variables are
of this type. I said "most", because there are a few examples
where cetain operaions  may not really make sense. Consider this
data set, where we record temperatures of different cities in the
month of January. While it is meaningful to say that Kolkata is
5 degrees warmer than Delhi, it is meaningless to say Kolkata is
double warmer than Delhi. This is because the temperatre scales
have arbitrary origins. What is double in one scale need not be
double in another. Thus, here difference is meaningful, but not
ratio.

Welcome back! We have learned quite a bit of stuff in the videos
so far. We have a basic idea about how data are collected, and
what are the different types of variables we are interested
in. So far we are looking at the variables one at a time. But in
most real life scenario we have more than one variable of
interest in the
data. I said "variable of interest" to exclude any identifier
variable that might be present. This is because we collect
different pieces of information for the same unit. Typically we
are interested in the interplay between these variables. Let's
take a toy example to understand this.
</fieldset>

<center>
<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">A toy example</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.70</i></legend>
Quantities in the real world are related in various ways, and one
of the aims of science is explore them. While some of the laws are
obtained by purely logical thinking, most others are ascertained
empirically based on data. In this toy example suppose we are
interested in exploring the relation between the sides of a right
angled triangle. Of course, we know that they are linked by 
Pythagoras' theorem, but like many such relations in nature let's
pretend that this is also initially unknown to the researcher. 
We start with this random collection of right angled triangles.
and  measure the lengths of their sides.
Thus, we have 4
variables, of which the very first one is an identifier. Now
these 6 triangles are just 6 random triangles, and so their order in the
data set is not important. Suppose we focus our attention on only
the hypotenuse. No information is lost about it if I 
reshuffle the numbers in its column.
And this is true about each the variables
individually. But does that mean that  I can reshuffle the numbers in each column
independently, and still not lose any information? Well,
no. Because then I shall end up with triangles like these, which
are not even  right angled!
Thus, important information like Pythagoras' theorem 
is lost! Reshuffling is OK, as long as we reshuffle entire
rows, and not merely the values in the columns
independently. Otherwise, we have no hope to recover the
inter-relation between the variables.
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.70</i></legend>
Well, this brings us to the distinction between
a <b>univariate</b> and <b>multivariate</b> data set. A
univariate scenario is where we are focusing our attention on
only one variable. There may be other variables also, but we are
interested in only one of them. A multivariate scenario, on the
other hand, involves more than one variable, and we are
interested in exploring their inter-relation. As the triangle example
showed, a multivariate data set is not merely just a collection
of some univariate data sets. All the variables need to be
considered together.
</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=1.40</i></legend>
Here's a more practical example of a bivariate
scenario. "Bivariate" as you have no doubt guessed is a pecial
case of multivariate, where we have only <i>two</i> variables of
interest. Similarly, <b>trivariate</b> is where the focus is on
only three variables. Anyway, our example is a bivariate one. The
units are schools, and we are interested in checking if a certain school
nurtures academic and physical skills in a balanced way. We draw a
random sample of students
 and
conduct two tests, one on academic skills and the other on
physical skills. Ths we get two variables, academic and
physical. There are students with high and low values in either
variable. But looking at each variable <i>separately</i> will not
let us answer our question. In this data set, for example, we
have a high scorer in academics, but they are in poor physical
training. The guys who are physically well-trained are flunking
in academics. Now let's just reshuffle the numbers in each
column. The new data set shows much better balance between
academic and physical training, as a students with high marks in
one are pypically getting high marks in the othr, as well.

good number of data manipulation activities. And just to keep it accessible

       Correct. Though there are two columns, yet the first
       column is merely for identifying the cases.

       No. Despite there being *two* columns in the data matrix,
       the first column is merely for identifying the cases.

       Well, there *are* more than one columns in the data

In the last few videos we have talked a lot about variables,
<i>i.e.</i>, the columns in the data matrix. But what about the rows,
<i>i.e.</i>, the cases? Well, that's what we are going to talk about
now. But first, when we think about cases, stop thinking of them
as a row of values, but as the totality of information about a
single unit. Visualise a unit as a single object, like a patient,
or a plot of land, a household, a student in a particular class,
and so on. When you do so, you might detect some layout of
these units that has bearing on the object of your study. Like,
they may be measurements of depth of a river at different points
along the river. Each point is then a unit, and they are laid out
spatially. A point near the source of the river may behave
differently from one near the estuary. In fact, the variation of
depth along the river may be the focus of attention in the
study. As yet another example, we might count number of COVID
infected persons in each month for an entire year. Here each
month is a unit, and the months are laid out uniformly along a
time line. This temporal layout is important because we may hope
to predict future values based on such a data set. Based on the
layout of the units we classify data in a number of ways:
  * Cross-sectional data
  * Time series and panel data
  * Spatial data
Let's discuss these one by one.

<img src="image/jingle.png"><font color="blue" size="+3">Cross-sectional data</font><img src="image/jingle.png"></center>

<fieldset><legend><i>Duration=0.70</i></legend>
This is the simplest possible scenario, where there is no particular
layout of the units. Most of our examples so far have been of
this type. Here you may reshuffle the cases (entire rows)
without destroying any important information. A special case is
where all the cases are
independent and as far as the study area is concerned are
expected to behave identically, all variations being due to
chance only. Such a cross-sectional data set is 
called an IID data set. IID is an acronym for Independent and
Identically Distributed. Typical examples are data from a random
sample.

</div>


In olden days people used to store data on paper. Now computer
disks provide the main storage. Data sets are stored as files, 
be it in the hard drive of a computer or removable devices like a
USB drive. A file in a computer is just a collection of 0's and
1's. When we store data  in a file,  they first need to be
converted into 0's and 1's. When we read the data back from the
file,  the 0's and 1's are converted back into the original
form. This two-way conversion process is mostly done
automatically without our intervention. Now,  this process may be
done in different ways,  and each such way is called a <b>file
format</b>. 
There are quite a few file formats that are used in
statistics. Some are free,  while others are propreitary and
require paid softwares to write or read. Some formats are good
for sending data files over the email,  while some formats are
optimised to hold a large amount of data in a small space. 


<p></p>

In this course we shall use the MS Excel software,  which
understands various file formats. We shall discuss only two of
them. Every file format has its specific file name extension. The
first format has the extension <b>.xlsx</b>. This is the default
file format used by MS Excel.

While the Excel format is adequate for many elementary
purposes,  there are a couple of drawbacks. First,  you need to
have MS Excel in order to view the data in the file,  or even to
make minor modifications. Second,  the file may be easily
corrupted if you send it by email. Third,  in case you want to
process the data by some other software,  this format may not be
recognised by that software. So it is a good idea to know about a
universally understood format,  called
the <b>comma-separated-values</b> format,  with file
extension <b>.csv</b>. In this format each case is represented by
a line and the values in each line are separated by a comma. This
format is particularly useful when a value may have a space in
it,  <i>e.g.</i> <b>West Bengal</b> or <b>Ram Singh</b>. Sometimes a
value may be missing. Such missing values may be easily marked by
two consecutive commas. 
<p></p>
On most computers a file with <b>.csv</b> format is automatically
opened in MS Excel,  if the software in installed. However,  the
CSV format has one downside. It cannot hold anything other than
a single data table,  while the XLSX format can hold multiple
tables,  as well as graphs and reports.

In the year 1958,  a war took place between the British and the
Russian. A particularly infamous battle fought in it was the
battle of Crimea,  where  a young nurse named Florence Nightingale,  along with a
small group of friends,   was providing
voluntary service at the battlefield. She was shocked to find
that more soldiers died of disease than in actual
fighting. She saw this clearly,  as did many others present at the
battlefield. But unfortunately the policy makers sitting in
London did not see this as clearly. Fortunately for the soldiers
and the posterity,  Florence Nightingale was not just a dedicated
nurse. She was also a statistician at heart,  one who knew how to
convince others using data. Data,  as a dumb jumble of numbers, 
were not appealing. She knew that. So she improvised a colourful
way to bring her point home. For each month she had the numbers
of deaths due to different causes. She gave a sector to each
month,  and split the sector into a number of parts,  one for each
cause. The resulting diagram is called Nighingale Rose Chart. It
indeed had so much impact on the policymakers that sanitary
condition of the soldiers improved considerably. 
<p></p>
This example shows the power of pictures. We use our eyes to
decide about our surroundings. Graphical representation of data
allows our eyes to perform quick statistical analysis. 
<p></p>
One may,  like Florence Nightingale,  improvise one's own way of
representing data graphically. But there are certain standard
methods,  which every statistician should know about. 

<div class="header">
<h2><a
name="Module 2, Lesson 1,  Video 2: Line diagram">Module 2, Lesson 1,  Video 2: Line diagram</a></h2>
</div>
The data used by Florence Nightingale are tim series data. The
most common way to depict such data is the <b>line chart</b>. 
This is just a graph with time shown in the $x$-axis,  and
the quantity of interest in the $y$-axis. If our data set
looks like this <b><font color="red">
[table shown] </font></b>,  then each row gives us a
point. We join them with piecewise straighlines to get a line
chart. 
If we multiple quantities of interest,  then we vave multiple
lines that may be plotted separately or,  to facilitate comarison, 
overlaid on the same plot. For instance,  Florence Nightingale
could have produced this plot to convey the same information as
her rose chart. However,  notice that her plot highlighted her
contension that diseases were the greatest killer more
forcefully.  This is an importnt consideration when choosing one
graphical technique over another: which is
more <b>convincing</b>? Unfortunatley,  it is easy to go
overboard,  and produce plots that almost present a distorted
version of trth. We shall talk more abot this later.

Scatter plot is a close kin of the line chart. Here we just show
the points without joining them with lines. Consider a height
weight data set. Here each case is a point. Typically,  the
variable which is less in our ontrol,  and is more relieably
measured,  is shown in the $x$-axis. If there are more than
two variables,  then we can use a scatter plot matrix,  sometimes
also called a pairs plot.

In this video we shall talk about a representation of data that
is definitely the one most commonly used: <b><font color="red">
[tabular
format] </font></b>. Be it a telephone directory or a dictionary or a
railway timetable,  tables are everywhere around us. Even when we
use a computer to look up information,  the underlying data base
is basically a collection of tables. 
<p></p>
A table,  as we all know,  presents data in a rectangular
format. Well,  we have already used them earlier in this course, 
where columns represent variables and row represent cases. Those
tables were meant primarily to be fed into a computer
program. But human-readbale tables can be (and should be) more
varied. They allow for various embellishments,  <b>nested rows</b>, 
<b>nested columns</b>,  <b>marginal summaries</b> <b>etc</b>.
Such fancy tables are often called <b>pivot tables</b>.
<p></p>
Let's start with an example.
