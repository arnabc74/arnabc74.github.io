    We are collecting household level data from 5 different
    villages. From each  villages  10 random  households are selected.
    For each selected household we collect data on monthly
    income,  main source of income,  and the number of people. If the
    resulting table has <M>n</M> rows and <M>p</M> columns,
    then:
  shuffleOptions: true
  options:
   - answer: <M>n=10</M> and <M>p=4</M>
     feedback: >
       Oops! <M>p</M> is the number of variables. How many
       variables are we having here? Also <M>n</M> is the
       total number of cases, i.e., the total number of households.
   - answer: <M>n=50</M> and <M>p=3</M>
     isCorrect: true
     feedback: >
       Bang on point! 10 households from each of 5 villages.
       That gives 50 cases in total. Also we have 3 variables.
   - answer: <M>n=50</M> and <M>p=4</M>
     feedback: > 
       Not quite! Your <M>n</M> is correct, but are there
       really 4 variables? 
   - answer: <M>n=10</M> and <M>p=3</M>
     feedback: > 
       Hmmm...let's see. You think there are just 10 households 
       in this study? Or 10 households from *each of 5 villages?*

    | Joseph Mathew |           2 |        4000 |

    What is the value of income in the 3rd case?

      The third case means row three *not counting the header row!*
      
  - answer: Rs 2345
    feedback: >
      The third case means row three (not counting the header row).
      You were possibly attracted by the 3 in the second column!
