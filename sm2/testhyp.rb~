<HEAD1>Test of hypotheses</HEAD1>
You can get the basics from my videos  or by reading section 7.1
of the Ramachandran and Tsokos book. 
<P/>
Here I shall point out two things that are generally overlooked or
glossed over in many places. 

<HEAD2>Which came first: hen or egg?</HEAD2>
Type I error is the error committed when you reject a
correct <M>H_0.</M> Most books present it as the definition of
type I error. In fact, this is the definition of <M>H_0.</M> The
definition of type I error is: the more serious of the two
errors. The judgement of "seriousness" comes from domain
knowledge. Then, for this serious error, the rejected hypothesis
is called <M>H_0,</M> the null hypothesis.
<P/>
In textbook problems, however, the domain knowledge is carefully
left out. So you have no way of judging the seriousness. Instead,
the two hypotheses are magically given the labels <M>H_0</M>
and <M>H_1</M>. You must understand that in the real world, the
two hypotheses do not come equipped with such labels. It
is <I>you</I>, the statistician, who labels them, and it is based
on the relative seriousness of the two errors. 

<HEAD2>Null hypothesis is our pet hypothesis</HEAD2>
If the eveidence in the data set is inconclusive, then we prefer
to accept <M>H_0</M> as we want to  avoid type I error more than type
II error. So acceptance of <M>H_0</M> does not mean we have
strong evidence <I>for</I> <M>H_0</M>. It means that there is
not strong evidence <I>against</I> it. However,
rejecting <M>H_0</M> means we have strong evidence
against <M>H_0</M> (or, equivalently strong evidence
for <M>H_1</M>). You must keep this in mind when you report you
conclusion in plain language:
<UL>
<LI>For accepting <M>H_0</M> you write: At 5\% (or whatever you have
chosen) level  of significance, the data do not have significant
evidence against ... (your <M>H_0</M> in plain language).</LI>
<LI>For accepting <M>H_0</M> you write: At 5\% (or whatever you have
chosen) level  of significance, the data  have significant
evidence that ... (your <M>H_1</M> in plain language).</LI>
</UL>
