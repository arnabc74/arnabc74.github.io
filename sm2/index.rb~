<HEAD2>Reference materials</HEAD2>
Our main textbooks are the following two excellent texts.
<DL>
<DT><B>Mathematical statistics with applications</B>
by <I>Ramachandran and Tsokos</I></DT>
<DD>We shall need only chapters 4,5,6 and 7.</DD>

<DT><B>Introduction to statistical theory</B> by <I>Hoel, Port
and Stone</I></DT>
<DD>We shall need only chapter 1, 2 and 3.</DD>

We shall
use the R environment (language plus libraries)   for all our computation. If you know Python,
that`s great, but please also learn R. We shall need only only a small
subset of features of R, that we shall discuss and demonstrate
in class. The following  books are for optional self-reading.

R. It has some things for you to type and watch the outputs to
explore R.</DD>
