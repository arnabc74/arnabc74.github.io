<HEAD1>Application of sampling distribution in quality control</HEAD1>
We often want to check if some parameter is at a certain
target value. But since the parameter is not directly observable we use
some estimator and check if the estimator value is "close" to
that value. To quantify the "closeness" we use the sampling
distribution of the estimator. We shall illustrate this with a
number of examples.

<HEAD2>Bottling plant</HEAD2>
Considering a bottling plant where milk is bottled. The empty
bottles come down a conveyor belt to be filled automatically. 
<CIMG web="bott1.png"/>
Our aim is to fill 500 ml of milk in each bottle. We set the
machine accordingly. Of course, there is some random fluctuation,
and each bottle may get slightly more or less than this target
amount. 
<P/>
We shall assume that amount of milk in a ranomly selected bottle
is a random variable with <M>N(\mu,\sigma^2)</M>
distribution. Initially, <M>\mu = 500</M> and <M>\sigma^2 </M> is
at some known acceptable value. We shall also assume
that <M>\sigma^2 </M> will stay put at this value all through
out. However, <M>\mu </M> may drift away from its target value
ovr time. If it does, we want to detect it as soon as possible,
stop the production line,  set the mean back to its target value, and
resume production.     
<P/>
Then problem is that <M>\mu </M> is not readily visible. 
<P/>
So we draw a random sample of size <M>n</M> from the production
line from time to time, and actually measure their
contents. Let <M>X_i</M> be the amount of milk in the <M>i</M>-th
bootle in our sample. Then, by our
assumption,   <M>X_1,...,X_n</M> are
iid <M>N(\mu,\sigma^2_0).</M> 
<P/>
We cannot observe <M>\mu.</M> So instead we estimate it
with <M>\bar X.</M> 
<P/>
Our aim is to check if <M>\mu  = 500.</M> Instead we check
if <M>\bar X\approx 500.</M> Notice the "<M>\approx</M>"
because <M>\bar X</M> may not exactly equal 500. More precisely,
we look for some <M>c</M> such that if <M>|\bar X-500|>c,</M> then
we shall stop the machine. Now, stopping the machine itself
incurs some loss of time and money. So we want to do so only when
we strongly feel the need. However, sometimes <M>|bar X-500|</M>
may exceed <M>c</M> just by chance evne when the machine is
under control (i.e., <M>\mu = 500</M>). Then we shall stop the
machine, waste time and money only to find that the hassle was
useless. So we want <M>P(|\bar X-500|>c)</M> to be low when the
process in under control. A typical choice for this low
probablity is 5%. In other words, we are looking for <M>c</M>
such that <M>P(|\bar X-500|>c) = 0.05</M> when <M>\mu = 500.</M>
<P/>
It is here that the sampling distribution of <M>\bar X</M>
proves useful. When the process is under control, we
have <M>X_1,...,X_n</M> iid <M>N(500, \sigma^2_0).</M> So <M>\bar
X\sim N(*(500, [[\sigma^2_0][n]])*),</M> or 
<D>
[[\bar X-500][\sigma_0/\sqrt n]]\sim N(0,1).
</D>
We need <M>P(|\bar X-500|>c) = 0.05</M> or <M>P(*([[|\bar
X-500|][\sigma_0/\sqrt n]]>[[c][\sigma_0/\sqrt n]])*) = 0.05</M>
or 
<D>
[[c][\sigma_0/\sqrt n]] = \Phi ^{-1} (0.975) = 1.96.
</D>
So we should take <M>c = [[1.96 \sigma_0][\sqrt n]].</M>
