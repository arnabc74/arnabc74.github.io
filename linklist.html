<h1><a
name="Linked lists">Linked lists</a></h1>
Suppose that I have a list of my friends on a piece of paper:
<pre>
Samprit
Atanu
Jonaki
Krishanu
Saikat
</pre>
The order is important, the first friend is the closest, the
next one the second closest, and so on. After writing the list up
to this, I suddenly recall that I have missed a name: Anvit. He
should be third in the list. Unfortunately, as I am writing on a
piece of paper, inserting a name between two names is difficult
(unless I use ugly scribbling). However, if my list were in a
computer, then it is very easy: I would just take my cursor after
Atanu, hit enter to create a black line (causing the everything
below to shift downwards by a line), and then type Anvit in the
blank line. In this way I can insert as many names as I wish in
any position. No scribbling, no squeezing. I might even remove
any number of names from the list, without leaving any ugly
gap. The list just grows,
stretches and shrinks as needed.
<p></p>
How does the computer manage this? Does it reserve lots of empty
spaces between every pair of names, to allow for future
insertions, and somehoow hide the spaces while displaying the
list? Not really. It uses a clever trick called a <b>linked
list</b>, which we shall discuss now.

<h2><a
name="Insertion">Insertion</a></h2>

When we make a list on paper, adding a new name is easy, as long
as you are adding it at the end. Well, internally the computer is
also writing the names on just such a piece of paper. This paper
has lines drawn on it, and every line is numbered. Thus, the
paper looks like this:
<pre>
1 Samprit
2 Atanu
3 Jonaki
4 Krishanu
5 Saikat
6
7
8
9
...
</pre>
Unlike our paper list, the computer also writes after each name
the number of the line where the next friend is to be found:
<pre>
1 Samprit   2
2 Atanu     3
3 Jonaki    4
4 Krishanu  5
5 Saikat    0
6
7
8
9
...
</pre>
The 0 after Saikat means that Saikat is the last name in the
list. Nothing interesting so far. Now suppose that I need to
insert Anvit in the third position. The computer simply writes
Anvit at the next available position:
<pre>
1 Samprit   2
2 Atanu     3
3 Jonaki    4
4 Krishanu  5
5 Saikat    0
6 Anvit
7
8
9
...
</pre>
I want Anvit to appear after Atanu. So I write 6 after Atanu.
Similarly,  Jonaki should appear after
Anvit. So I write 3 after Anvit:
<pre>
1 Samprit   2
2 Atanu     <font color="#ff0000">6</font>
3 Jonaki    4
4 Krishanu  5
5 Saikat    0
6 Anvit     <font color="#ff0000">3</font>
7
8
9
...
</pre>
Is this clear. Then try these exercises.

<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Insert the name Arko after Krishanu.
Next, insert the name Oishi <i>before</i> Saikat. 
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Which is more difficult:
inserting <i>after</i> a given name, or <i>before</i> a given
name? Will the difficulty increase if the list is very long?
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Add Subroto after Saikat. Thus, Subroto is now the last in the list.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>

Now suppose I suddenly find a long lost friend, Arinjita, and
must give her the first place. So I need to update the list as
follows.
<pre>
1 Samprit   2
2 Atanu     6
3 Jonaki    4
4 Krishanu  5
5 Saikat    0
6 Anvit     3
7 Arinjita  1
8
9
...
</pre>
But here you'll have a problem while displaying the list. We have
to start from Arinjita (<i>i.e.</i>, line 7) and not from line 1. How on
earth are we to know where to start from? The computer needs to keep track of that separately. It
calls the line number corresponding to the first name
the <b>head</b>. So far, the head was always 1. But after
inserting Arinjita, the head changes to 7. Henceforth, we shall
denote the head with a star:
<pre>
 1 Samprit   2
 2 Atanu     6
 3 Jonaki    4
 4 Krishanu  5
 5 Saikat    0
 6 Anvit     3
*7 Arinjita  1
 8
 9
...
</pre>


<h2><a
name="Deletion">Deletion</a></h2>
We talked about inserting a name in the list. Deleting is even
easier. Suppose that we want to delete the name after line number
2. The next line number is 6 (Anvit), and after that comes line 3
(Jonaki). Our aim is to delete Anvit from the list, <i>i.e.</i>, we
should have Jonaki coming right after Atanu. Convince yourself
that the following updating achieves this:
<pre>
 1 Samprit   2
 2 Atanu     <font color="#ff0000">3</font>
 3 Jonaki    4
 4 Krishanu  5
 5 Saikat    0
 6 Anvit     3
*7 Arinjita  1
 8
 9
 ...
</pre>
Notice that we do not need to do anything to line 6. Just by
making sure that line 6 is not referred by others, we are
effectively removing Anvit from the list.

<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Delete the head from the list, <i>i.e.</i>, delete Arinjita making the
next guy, Samprit the new head.

<h2><a
name="Implementing in C">Implementing in C</a></h2>
As the discussion above shows, the computer maintains a secret paper
list (which can only grow), and displays the final list cleverly
by following the next line numbers. Well, as you might have
guessed, there is really no paper list inside a computer. The
role of the paper is played by the memory of the computer. This
memory is indeed like a long (very l..o..n..g) piece of papers
with many lines marked on it. Just as in our example, the lines
are numbered consecutively. Each lines is 
called a <b>location</b> and its  number is called
its <b>address</b>. As there are a huge number of locations, the
address easily runs into 20 digits or so!
<p></p>
Now, we need to associate a location with an address. There has
to to be a 2-way communication: address to location, and location
to address. If you have a variable <font color="red"><code>x</code></font> stored at some
location, then its address is given by <font color="red"><code>&amp;x</code></font>. Conversely, if
the address of a location is stored in a variable
called <font color="red"><code>p</code></font>, then the corresponding location
is <font color="red"><code>*p</code></font>. Incidentally, just as integers are stored
in <font color="red"><code>int</code></font>'s and characters in <font color="red"><code>char</code></font>'s, there are
special types of variables to hold addresses
called <b>pointer</b>s.
<p></p>
Thus, to store a name and the address of the next student we need
a string and a pointer. Typically, you package them as follows in
C:
<span class="j">
<pre>
struct <font color="#ff0000">stdnt</font> {
  char <font color="#ff0000">name</font>[80];
  struct <font color="#0000ff">stdnt</font> *<font color="#ff0000">next</font>;
}
</pre>
</span>
Yes, it is ugly. Nobody denies that. But that is how it is in
C. Here the red words are words of our choice. The black words
are parts of the C language. The word <font color="red"><code>stdnt</code></font> has occurred
twice (the second occurrence is shown in blue).
