<HEAD1>The basic workflow</HEAD1>
Before we get into complicated things, we should familiarise
ourselves with the basic workflow. 
Understand the workflow first without bothering about the GUI. 
<OL>
<LI>Select the frame.</LI>
<LI>Update the scene.</LI>
<LI>Select the object.</LI>
<LI>Select the tracks that you want to keyframe.</LI>
<LI>Add the keyframes.</LI>
</OL>
You may need to spend some time before you can wrap your brain
around these. Here are some mistakes that beginners do:
<OL>
<LI>Forgetting to select the keyframe first. You update
everything, and then notice that you are still at the last
keyframe. Your natural impulse is to go to the correct
frame <I>now</I>. Immediately, all your updates are lost! You
try to restore by going back to the last frame, but the updates
do not return. You hit undo, possibly destroying some earier good work!
The reason is simple, adding a keyframe is like saving a
file. If you edit a file, and close the editor without saving
your work, and then return to it, your work will be lost, and no
amount of undoing would bring back the lost work! Sad but
true. Moral: Never forget to select the new frame before
updating your scene.</LI>
<LI>Forgetting to select the tracks. Then no keyframe will be
added, which means your work is still not saved, and is on the
brink of being irrevocably lost! Moral: Always ensure that you
see some visual proof that the keyframes are indeed created before you
change frame.</LI>
<LI>Forgetting to add the keyframe. Well, you now know the consequence. </LI>
</OL>

<HEAD2>Keyframe twice per motion</HEAD2>
This is a simple point, but often hard to remember. If you want
to animate an object during a certain span, remember to
keyframe <I>both</I> at the first and last frame of that span.  

<EXM> Consider a
very simple situation consisting of a cube and sphere. The cube
moves first for the first 30 frames, while the sphere is
stationary. Then the sphere moves for next 30 frames, while
the cube remains fixed. Let us see a wrong approach taken by many
beginners:
<OL>
<LI>Select frame 1.</LI>
<LI>Place the two objects in their initial position.</LI>
<LI>Add keyframe to both the objects.</LI>
<LI>Select frame 30.</LI>
<LI>Update the position of the cube.</LI>
<LI>Add keyframe to cube.</LI>
<LI>Select frame 60.</LI>
<LI>Update the position of the sphere.</LI>
<LI>Add keyframe to sphere.</LI>
</OL>
You will find (to your dismay) that the sphere starts moving
right from the beginning! This is what you should have done:
<OL>
<LI>Select frame 1.</LI>
<LI>Place the two objects in their initial position.</LI>
<LI>Add keyframe to both the objects.</LI>
<LI>Select frame 30.</LI>
<LI>Update the position of the cube.</LI>
<LI><RED>Add keyframe to both the cube and the sphere.</RED></LI>
<LI>Select frame 60.</LI>
<LI>Update the position of the sphere.</LI>
<LI>Add keyframe to sphere.</LI>
</OL>
Keyframing the sphere at frame 30 may appear redundant, as the
sphere has not changed since the last keyframe! But think about
the graph to see what has one wrong.

<HEAD2>Animating an object hierarchy</HEAD2>
This is of great importance in two situations:
<UL>
<LI>When the objects are naturally linked.</LI>
<LI>When an object needs to be rotated around a point other
than its centre.</LI>
</UL>

First you should learn how to move the entire hierarchy in the
way you want. This means applying transformations (not setting
the layout directly, as it will not propagate). You should start
with the top object, then gradually work you way down, if
needed. 
<P/>
Once you are sure about the steps, select <I>all</I> the objects
in the hierarchy, and keyframe at the beginning. Then move to the
last frame, deselect everything, and apply the
transformation. Then finally select everything again, and
keyframe everything again.
