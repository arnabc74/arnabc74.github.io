The <M>MA(q)</M> is 
<D>
X_t = \beta_0 \epsilon_t + \beta_1 \epsilon_1 \epsilon_{t-1} +
\cdots + \beta_q \epsilon_{t-q},
</D>
where the <M>\beta_i</M>'s are (unknown) fixed parameters
and <M>(\epsilon_t)\sim WN(0,\sigma_\epsilon^2).</M> 

<P/>
Using <M>B</M>-notation, this may be written as <M>X_t =
\theta(B) \epsilon_t,</M> where 
<D>
\theta(z) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 z + \cdots + \beta_q z^q.
</D>

<P/>
We may assume, w.l.g., <M>\beta_0 = 1.</M> This is what is done
in most applications, though the notation <M>\beta_0</M> helps
while writing formulae. 
<P/>
Clearly <M>(X_t)</M> is (weakly/strongly) stationary according
as <M>(\epsilon_t)</M> is (weakly/strongly) stationary.

It is interesting to note that the ACF cuts off after
lag <M>q.</M> This gives us a way to guess <M>q</M> just by
looking at ACF. 
<COMMENT>
Is it possible to estimate the <M>\beta_i</M>'s
as well, just by looking at ACF? Unfortunately, no. The
map <M>(1,\beta_1...,\beta_q)\to</M>ACF is not 1-1. However,
something interesting happens here: this map is 2-1, i.e., given
the ACF, there are exactly <I>two</I> sets
of <M>(1,\beta_1...,\beta_q)</M> that lead to that ACF.

The model is 
<D>
X_t = \alpha_1 X_{t-1}+\cdots+\alpha_p X_{t-p}+\epsilon_t,\quad t\in\zz,
</D>
where the <M>\alpha_i</M>'s are (unknown) fixed parameters, and <M>(E_t)\sim WN(0,\sigma^2_\epsilon).</M>

<P/>
This looks like a recursive definition, but unlike a usual
recursive definition, we are not given any initial values to
start the recursion from. Instead, <M>t</M> is allowed to take
all integer values! So how we start the recursion? Does it even
make sense?
<P/>
Well, it does. In fact, we may show (some non-trivial probablity
arguement required) that given any white
noise, <M>(\epsilon_t)</M>, there is a unique weakly stationary
process <M>(X_t)</M> that satisfies the above recursive
relation.
