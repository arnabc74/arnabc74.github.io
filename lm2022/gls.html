The Gauss-Markov set up postulates an error covariance matrix of
the form $\sigma^2 I.$ However, we have seen in an
exercise <a href="model.html#ex">earlier</a> that we can
reduce any covariance matrix of the form $\sigma^2 \Sigma $
(for a <i>known</i> PD matrix $\Sigma$) to the Gauss-Markov
set up by replacing $\v y$ with $S ^{-1} \v y,$
where $\Sigma = S S'.$ More specifically, let the original
model be 
$$
\v y = X \v \beta + \v \epsilon,
$$
where $\v \epsilon \sim N_n(\v 0, \sigma^2 \Sigma)$ for
some <i>known</i> PD matrix $\Sigma$ and
some <i>unknown</i> $\sigma^2&gt;0.$ 
<p></p>
Then we find <a href="javascript:hideShow('chol');">(How?)</a>
<div id="chol" style="display:none;background-color:#ffcccc;">Such an $S$ may be found by
Cholesky decomposition (sounds like Kolesky). 
<font color="red">
<pre>
Sigma = matrix(c(2,1,1,2),2)
S = chol(Sigma)
t(S) %*% S 
</pre>
</font>

</div>some nonsingular $S$ such that $\Sigma =
S'S$, and multiply the model from the left by $T=(S ^{-1})'$
to get the model:
$$
T \v y = T X \v \beta + T \v \epsilon.
$$
Here $T\v \epsilon \sim N_n(\v 0, \sigma^2 I).$
Thus, we are back to the Gauss-Markov set up. This is called
the <b>Generalised Least Squares (GLS)</b> method. In the special
case when $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix (with unequal
diagonal entries) it is also 
called the <b>weighted least squares</b> method.
<p></p>


In many cases however, $\Sigma $
will involve unknown parameters.

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Sometimes we make repeated measurements under the same input
combination to get an idea of the effect of the random errors. If
these repeated measurements are made quickly in succession, then
these measurements may be correlated. A typical model could be
like 
$$
y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij},
$$
where $i=1,...,3$ and $j=1,2.$ Here 
 $\epsilon_{i1}, \epsilon_{i2}$ could have some unknown
 correlation $\rho.$ Thus the covariance matrix of $\v
 \epsilon $ is $\sigma^2\\Sigma(\rho),$
 where $\Sigma(\rho)$ is the correlation matrix of the
 following form:
$$
\Sigma(\rho) = \left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
1    &amp; \rho &amp; 0    &amp; 0     &amp; 0&amp; 0\\
\rho &amp; 1    &amp; 0    &amp; 0     &amp; 0&amp; 0\\
 0   &amp; 0    &amp; 1    &amp; \rho  &amp; 0&amp; 0\\
 0   &amp; 0    &amp; \rho &amp; 1     &amp; 0&amp; 0\\
 0   &amp; 0    &amp; 0    &amp; 0     &amp; 1    &amp; \rho\\
 0   &amp; 0    &amp; 0    &amp; 0     &amp; \rho &amp; 1

\end{array}\right].
$$
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>
In general, we may be dealing with linear models of the form 
$$
\v y = X\v \beta + \v \epsilon\text{ where } E(\v \epsilon)=\v0
and  V(\v \epsilon) =  \sigma^2 \Sigma(\v \theta).
$$
We shall assume that the form of the correlation
matrix $\Sigma(\cdot)$ is known,
but $\v \theta$ and $\sigma^2 $ is unknown. 

<p></p>
In the example above we had $\v \theta = \rho.$
<p></p>
Typically, we may estimate $\v
\beta,$ $\sigma^2 $ and $\v
\theta$ using (some variant of) maximum likelihood method. A
simpler method called 
<b>Iteratedly Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)</b> is sometimes
used to get good initial values for the interations required by
the likelihood method. 

<p></p>
 The
IRLS technique starts with a guess of $\v \theta,$ say $\v
\theta_0.$ Then it performs GLS assuming that this to be the
 true calue of $v \theta.$ The coeffcients are estimated
 from this fit, and residuals are computed. Then $\v \theta$
 is estimated based on these residuals (depending on the form
 of $\Sigma(\v \theta).$ Let the new estimates by $\v
 \theta_1.$ Then the whole process of GLS is repeated with
 these. We continue like this until convergence.

<h1><a
name="Using R">Using R</a></h1>
The <code>gls</code> function of the R package <code>nlme</code>
performs linear model fitting in presence of correlated,
heterscedastic errors. Notice the slight mismatch in
terminology. The standard definition of GLS assumes
a <i>known</i> correlation matrix, while R
function <code>gls</code> allows the correlation matrix to have
unknown parameters. The exact form is 
$$
\sigma^2 D \Sigma D,
$$
where $D$ is a diagonal matrix involving some
parameters, $\Sigma$ is a correlation matrix involving a
different set of parameters, and $\sigma^2$ is a scalar parameter.
<p></p>
 There are are some standard form of
correlation matrices already built-in:
<pre>
  corAR1    : autoregressive process of order 1.

 corARMA    : autoregressive moving average process, with arbitrary orders
          for the autoregressive and moving average components.

 corCAR1    : continuous autoregressive process (AR(1) process for a
          continuous time covariate).

corCompSymm : compound symmetry structure corresponding to a constant
          correlation.

  corExp    : exponential spatial correlation.

 corGaus    : Gaussian spatial correlation.

  corLin    : linear spatial correlation.

corRatio    : Rational quadratics spatial correlation.

corSpher    : spherical spatial correlation.

 corSymm    : general correlation matrix, with no additional structure.
</pre>


<p></p>
Here is an example taken from the <code>gls</code> documentation.
The data set is <code>Ovary</code> that counts the number of
follicles in the ovaries of 11 mares during a menstrual
cycle. The response variable is a count, but here we treat it as
a continuous variable. The input is time. 
<font color="red">
<pre>
gls(follicles ~ sin(2*pi*Time) + cos(2*pi*Time), Ovary,
                weights = varPower(),                     #Specifying the structure of the D matrix
                correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | Mare))  #Specifying the structure of the Sigma matrix

<h1><a
name="REML">REML</a></h1>
There is no single expansion for the abbreviation REML. Some
expand it to REsidual Maximum Likelihood, while others prefer
REduced Maximum Likelihood or REstricted Maximum Likelihood.
<p></p>

We know that MLE of variance parameters are usually biased. The
simplest case is estimating the variance based
on $X_1,...,X_n$ IID with unknown variance $\sigma^2.$
The MLE is $\h \sigma^2 = \frac 1n\sum (X_i-\b X)^2,$ which is
biased. We can of course tweak it lightly to get the unbiased
estimator $\h \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum (X_i-\b X)^2.$ 
<p></p>
This may be generalised to $\h \sigma^2 = \frac{RSS}{n-r}$ for
the linear model $y = X \beta + \epsilon.$

<p></p>
It is possible to slightly tweak the ML procedure so that it
automatically produces the unbiased estimates. The teaked version
is called <b>REML</b>.  First we
need to understand the usual ML method for singular
distributions. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Suppose our data consist of $X_1,X_2$ IID $N(\mu,1).$
Then we know how to form the likelihood: just use the joint
density. However, if you are also given $X_3 = X_1+X_2,$
then the joint distribution of $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ is singular
(it resides in a lower dimensional space in ${\mathbb R}^3$), and
hence has no density. How do form the likelihood here?
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
Consider the situation intuitively: $X_3$ does not bring any
extra information. So just drop it, and stick to $(X_1,X_2)$
as our data. So the likelihood of $(X_1,X_2)$ is still the
likelihood of $(X_1,X_2,X_3).$ Of course, we could as well
have kept $(X_1,X_3),$ and thrown away $X_2.$ That
would also give us a likelihood. A little thinking should
convince you 
that this also leads to the same likelihood. For example, suppose
the data are $X_1=3.4,$ $X_2 = 2.3$ and $X_3 =
5.7.$ Clearly, $\{X_1=3.4,\,X_2=2.3\}$
and $\{X_2=2.3,\,X_3=5.7\}$ and $\{X_1=3.4,\,X_3=5.7\}$
are the same event!
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>
So when we are faced with singular data distribution, we throw
away the redundancy (any way is as good as any other way), and
then report the likelihood based on the remaining data. 
<p></p>
Now we are in a position to explain REML. We shall start with an
example. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
Consider $y_1, y_2, y_3$ IID $N(\mu, \sigma^2).$ We shall
cast it as a linear model. Then the residuals are $e_i = y_i-\b
y$'s. The REML method is to apply ML based on
the $e_i$'s. Notice that $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ has a singular
distribution, since $\sum e_i = 0.$ We shall throw
away $e_3$. Then the joint distribution
of $(e_1,e_2)$ is normal with mean 0 and 
$$
cov(e_1,e_2) 
= cov(y_1,y_2) + var(\b y) - cov(y_1,\b y) - cov(y_2,\b y) = 
=  - \frac{\sigma^2}{3}.
$$ 
Also, $V(e_1)= V(e_2) = \frac{2 \sigma^2}{3}.$
<p></p>

Thus the covariance matrix is $\Sigma = \sigma^2\cdot A$,
where $A=\frac 13\left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}2
&amp; -1\\-1&amp;2
\end{array}\right].$
 
<p></p>
The log-likelihood is 
$$
\ell(\sigma^2) = \mbox{constant} - \frac 12\log \sigma^2 -
\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (e_1\quad e_2)A^{-1} \left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}e_1\\e_2
\end{array}\right]. 
$$
A little computation would show that $(e_1\quad e_2)A^{-1} \left[\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}e_1\\e_2
\end{array}\right] = e_1^2+e_2^2+e_3^2.$

<p></p>
So solving $\ell'(\sigma^2) = 0,$ we shall get 
$$
\h\sigma^2 = \frac{e_1^2+e_2^2+e_3^2}{2},
$$
which is our familiar formula.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>
Even this simple example was not entirely straightforward,
especially that "little computation" part. The following example
takes a more careful approach  so that we can deal with any
linear model.

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
This time we start with a linear model in the general form 
$$
y = X \beta + \epsilon.
$$ 
Obtain REML of $\sigma^2$ by applying ML on $ e.$
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
We know that $ e = (I-P_X) y\in \col(I-P_X).$  
<p></p>
We shall remove redundancy from $ e$ cleverly this
time. We shall take any ONB of $\col(I-P_X),$ and stack the
vectors as columns to create a matrix $B_{n\times (n-r)}.$
Though $ e$ consists of $n$ numbers, yet expressed
w.r.t. 
this basis there are only $n-r$ numbers, $w_1,...,w_{n-r}.$
<p></p>
If we write $w = (w_1,...,w_{n-r})',$ then $w = B' e.$
<p></p>
Since $B'P = O,$ hence $w = B' e = B'(I-P_X) y = B'y.$
<p></p>
So $w\sim N(0,\sigma^2 B'B) = N(0,\sigma^2 I_{n-r}).$
<p></p>
See the advantage of being clever while removing the redundancy? 
<p></p>
The log-likelihood based on $w$ is 
$$
\ell(\sigma^2) = \log \sigma^2 + \frac{w'w}{\sigma^2}.
$$
Solving $\ell'(\sigma^2) = 0,$ we immediately get 
$$
\h \sigma^2 = \frac{w'w}{n-r} = \frac{e'e}{n-r},
$$
as expected.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>
Such an nice analytical expression was possible because we
assumed the dispersion matrix of $\epsilon $ to
be $\sigma^2 I.$ Had we assumed it to be
some $\Sigma(\theta),$ where $\theta$ is unknown (but
the form of $\Sigma(\cdot)$ being known), we would face a
bit more trouble.
First, $\h \beta $ may not have a closed-form expression any
more. The maximisation w.r.t. $\beta$ and $\theta$ are
entangled together. We shall proceed step by step: Let $\h
\beta(\theta)$ be the likelihood maximiser for a given $\theta.$
We shall apply ML on $e(\theta) = y-X \beta(\theta).$
$$
\ell(\theta) = \log |\Sigma(\theta)| + w' \Sigma(\theta) ^{-1} w.
$$
After this, REML has to proceed numerically.

We want to fit the regression model $y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i +
\epsilon_i,$ where $x$ is the weight hung from a spring, and $y$ is the
resulting length of the spring. We assume
that $\epsilon_i$'s have $N(0, \sigma^2)$ distribution
for some unknown $\sigma^2&gt;0,$
and that measurements involving the same weights are correlated
with unknown correlation $\rho\in[-1,1].$ Estimate all the
parameters ($\alpha,\beta,\sigma^2,\rho$) using any of the
techniques discussed in this page.

Also $\epsilon_{ij}$'s all have the same unknown
