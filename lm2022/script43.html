<h1><a
name="Generalised Linear Model">Generalised Linear Model</a></h1>
We shall now start discussing Generalised Linear Models (GLM). In
linear model, as we have already seen, we had this box diagram. 

There were some inputs, categorical or continuous, a random error
input, which as continuous. The output was always asumed to be
continuous. However, in many situations we need the output to be
discrete, say a categorical or a count variable. That is where we
need a Generalised Linear Model.

<h2><a
name="A little bit of history">A little bit of history</a></h2>
Possibly, the very first use of generalised linear model was made
by D J Finney, who was a toxicologist, a scientist investigating
poison. He wanted to measure the strength of a poison
quantitatively. For this he used lethal dose for a poison, the minimum dose of
the poison needed to kill. Of course, the dose depended not only
on the poison, but also on what he was trying to kill, mice or
rabbits or human beings. So ideally we should talk about the
lethat dose of a poison for a particular population. Even within
a homogeneous population there are bound to be some random
variations among the minimum amounts needed for the different
members. Thus, lethal dose is a random variable, just as height
and blood pressure are random variables. So a meaningful way to
capture the strenght of a poison is the expected value of this
random variable. 

Finney worked with a population of mice, and took a random sample
out of that population. Let the lethal doses of the poison for
these mice be 
$$
X_1,...,X_n.
$$
He assumed that these are IID $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ (We shall 
 relax the Gaussianity assumption later.) Then $\mu $
 measures the <b>potency</b> of the poison (for that population),
 and $\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$ measures the <b>reliability</b> of
 the poison.

This naturally leads to the apparently simple process: Grab a
sample of mice, find the lethal dodes for them to get a random
sample, then estimate $\mu $ and $\sigma^2.$ Pretty
simple, huh?

All that we haveto do is this: start applying the poison drop by
drop to the first mouse, and stop the moment it dies, and record
the dose administered. That is $X_1.$ Now repeat with the
other mice. 

But this experiment, howsoever simple it may sound, is
nevertheless impossible to be carried out in practice. The
trouble is with the condition "stop the moment it dies". Death of
a mouse (or of any other living being under the continued
application of a poison) is not an easily discernible
event. After a stage the mouse goes into a coma state, and it is
difficult to judge if it is dead or alive. An objective decision
may be obtained only by a lengthy procedure, for which you have
to discontinue the poison injection. Say this death detection
takes 10 minutes, after which we see that the mouse is still
living. Still we cannot resume injecting further poison into the
poor creature, as during those 10 minutes the purgatory system of
the mouse has worked frantically and have removed part of the
poison from its blood stream. So the effective amounf of poison
still in its blood is unknown to the experimenter. 

This is a serious  problem   with <b>bio-assay</b>, <i>i.e.</i>,
assesing the effect of chemicals on a living being. Due to this
problem, all an experimenter can really do in practice with a
mouse is to administer a predetermined a dose of poison, and then
detect if the mouse is still living or not. 

Thus, Finney was set back by the problem of not being able to
observe the $X_i$'s, which he needed to estimate the
parameters. Such random quantities that cannot be measured
directly are called <b>latent variables</b>.

Finney devised a clever work-around, which was the first instance
of a generalised linear model. Here is his scheme.

He took a grid of values for the dose. Then for each dose he
took, say, $n$ mice. To each of these he applied that dose, and
counted the number, $K$, of deaths. Then 
$\frac Kn\approx P(X\leq d) = \Phi\left(\frac{d-\mu}{\sigma}\right),$ where $d$ is the dose,
and $X$ is the random variable denoting the lethal
dose. 

He did this for each dose $d_i,$ and got corresponding
values $K_i.$ 

Thus, he had $\Phi ^{-1} \left(\frac{K_i}{n}\right)\approx
\frac{d_i-\mu}{\sigma},$  which is a linear graph. So he
plotted $\Phi ^{-1} \left(\frac{K_i}{n}\right)$'s
against $d_i$'s, fitted a least squares line, and estimated
the potency and reliability based on that.

Finney called the function $\Phi ^{-1} (\cdot)$
the <b>probit function</b> (actually he used the term for  $\Phi
^{-1} (\cdot)+5$, the 5 being added to avoid negative numbers, which were
difficult to handle in those pre-computer days). In modern
parlance, we call $\Phi ^{-1} (\cdot)$ the probit function,
and the statistical method used by Finney came to be known as the
Probit method.  
  
This technique has now been made more sophisticated, and is used
frequently for bio-assay to test safety of eye cosmetics. The
harmful cemicals are applied to the eyes of rabbits, and an
analysis like this is performed to assess the safe
level. Thousands of rabbits turn blind every year due to this
abominable practice.

<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Consider the following data obtained by an experimental set up as
described above. 
<pre>
| Dose | Number of mice | Number of deaths |
|------+----------------+------------------|
|  2.0 |            100 |                2 |
|  2.1 |            100 |                5 |
|  2.2 |            100 |               34 |
|  2.3 |            150 |               75 |
|  2.4 |            100 |               78 |
|  2.5 |             50 |               49 |

<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Consider the same set up and data as above. But now use MLE. 
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>


<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Repeat the first exercise, but with logiic distribution instead of
normal distribution. That is, replace the standard normal CDF by
the logistic CDF 
$$
F(x) = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x},~~x\in{\mathbb R}.
$$
