<HEAD2>Reference</HEAD2> 
The main textbook is 
<B>Linear models with R</B> by <I>Julian J. Faraway</I>. It is
written in a non-mathematical way with due emphasis on the
statistical applications. 
<P/>
A more mathematical exposition (not recommended for this course) is available in the following two
books:
 <UL>
<LI><B>Linear Models_ An Integrated Approach</B> by <I>Sreenivasa
Rao Jammalamadaka, Debasis Sengupta</I></LI>
<LI><B>Plane answers to Complex Questions</B> by <I>Ronald Christensen</I></LI>
</UL>
A rather fat book (about 1400 pages) that presents everything in
great details is 
<UL>
<LI><B>Applied Linear Statistical Models</B> by <I>Kutner,
Nachtsheim, Neter and Li.</I></LI>
</UL>
