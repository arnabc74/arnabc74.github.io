<h1><a
name="Basic concepts">Basic concepts</a></h1>
A <b>random experiment</b> is an activity whose outcome we cannot
predict. The set of all outcomes is called its <b>sample space</b>. Each
element of this set is called a <b>sample point</b>. 
By the term <b>event</b>  we understand a subset of the sample
space. 
<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;A coin toss is a random experiment. Its sample space is $\{head,tail\}.$  There are four
 different events possible here: 
$\phi, \{head\},\{tail\},\{head,tail\}.$
 ///
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;Rolling a die is another random experiment. The sample space here is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}.$ 
 One possible event is the set of all even numbers, $\{2,4,6\}.$ ///
</p>

<p></p>
I give you a coin to toss. Before tossing, you carefully inspect
it. You find no difference at all between the two sides (except
for the pictures on them). So you infer that both head and tail
are <i>equally likely</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, you are equally ignorant about
both sides). It is common to express this situation as "50-50"
chance, or $50\%$ chance of a head (or a tail), or probability of a head (or a tail) is $\frac 12.$
<p></p>
The main idea is that the chance of a head equals the chance of a
tail. We like to express this by first imagining a totality and
then halving it. This totality may be taken as 100 or 100% or 1 or any other positive number.
<p></p>
In probability theory we take the total as $1.$  This choice
is justified by statistical regularity, as the following example
shows.
<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;
Consider rolling a fair die. Let $A$ be the event that we
get a prime number, <i>i.e.</i>, $A=\{2,3,5\}.$ Intuitively, the
probability of $A$ should be $\frac 12.$  We shall use R to 
perform  5000 trials of this random experiment and check the running proportion of
cases that the event $A$ happens.
<font color="red">
<pre>
x = sample(6,5000,rep=T)
A = x %in% c(2,3,5)
plot(cumsum(A)/(1:5000), ty='l')
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
x = sample(6,5000,rep=T)
A = x %in% c(2,3,5)
plot(cumsum(A)/(1:5000), ty='l')
`));"/> 
Notice that the proportions indeed tend towards $\frac 12.$
<p></p>

<p></p>
Similarly, we can get an idea of the probability of $B=\{1,3,4,5\}$ using
the following R code.
<font color="red">
<pre>
x = sample(6,5000,rep=T)
B = x %in% c(1,3,4,5)
mean(B)
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
x = sample(6,5000,rep=T)
B = x %in% c(1,3,4,5)
mean(B)
`));"/>
 ///
</p>

<p></p>
With each event we assign a probability
which is a number from $[0,1].$ In practice it is difficult
(<a href="refs/headswithJ.pdf">impossible?</a>) to get a biased coin (<i>i.e.</i>, a coin which is more likely
to show one side than the other). It is very easy to <i>simulate</i>
such a coin though:
<font color="red">
<pre>
x = sample(c('h', 't'), 1000, prob=c(0.7,0.3), rep=T)
sum(x=='h')
sum(x=='t')
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
x = sample(c('h', 't'), 1000, prob=c(0.7,0.3), rep=T)
sum(x=='h')
sum(x=='t')
`));"/>
The <font size="+1" color="red"><code>prob=c(0.7,0.3)</code></font> specifies the probabilities. 
<table align="right" width="20%" border="1">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="pink">If the sample space is countable (finite/infinite), then
generally $\ev$ is just the power set of $\Omega.$
If $\Omega$ is uncountable, then there may be some <a href="vit.html">"bad"
subsets</a> for which probability cannot be defined! These are
not called events, and so are not considered as members of $\ev.$ In this case
$\ev$ is a strict subset of the power set of $\Omega.$ Fortunately, 
we shall not come across such "bad" subsets any time soon.</td>
</tr>
</table> 

<p></p>
Let $\ev$  be the set of all events in a sample space. For
example, if $\Omega = \{head, tail\}$ then $\ev$
is $\big\{\phi,\{head\},\{tail\},\{head,tail\} \big\}.$
<p></p>

<p></p>
Then a <b>probability</b>  is a function $P:\ev\rightarrow[0,1].$
<p></p>
Of course, not all such functions  can be a probability. A function needs to satisfy certain
 common sense conditions to be called a probability function. 
<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;
A report says that the health condition in a country is so bad, that the chance of a newborn baby surviving for at least
 1 year is only 50%. However, the chance that he survives for at least 5 years is 90%. Does it sound odd?
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
Yes. Any baby surviving for at least 5 years has of course survived the first year as well. So how can the latter chance
 be larger?
 ///
</p>

<p></p>
This example gives one common sense condition that a probability function must satisfy: if $A\subseteq B$ then we should
have $P(A)\leq P(B).$ 
<p></p>
Of course, there are many many such common sense conditions and it is difficult to come up with a complete list. 
A Russian mathematician named 
Kolmogorov reduced this list to only 3 conditions, called the <b>probability axioms</b>.
<p></p>

Let $\Omega$ denote the sample space. Let $\ev$  denote the set of all events. Then 
<ol type="">

<li>For any event $A\in\ev$ we have $P(A)\geq 0$</li>

<table align="right" width="20%" border="1">

Notice the last axiom. Here the sum may involve infinitely many
terms. Such a sum is called an infinite series. You'll learn
about them in details in your analysis course. But for now you
may quickly read this
<a href="series.html">crash course on infinite series</a>.
<p></p>

<p></p>
It is a remarkable fact that whatever other common sense condition one has been able to think of so far
actually follows as a consequence of these! Also, you cannot drop
any of these requirements, in the sense that no two of these
imply the other. Can you show this?
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
It is an interesting exercise to derive various common sense
conditions from these axioms. Here is one.
<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;
If $A\subseteq B$ then show that $P(A)\leq P(B).$
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
Split $B$ as $B=A\cup (A^c\cap B).$

 The two events in RHS  are
disjoint. So by Axiom 3 we have
$$
P(B) = P(A) + P(A^c\cap B).
$$
The second probability in the RHS is $\geq 0$ (by Axiom
1). So done.

<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXERCISE:</b>&nbsp;
Show $P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).$

<p></p>
Next we shall prove some common sense properties that will require more effort.
<p></p>

<h3><a
name="Continuity of probability function">Continuity of probability function</a></h3>
We know that if $f(x)$  is a continuous function and $x_n\rightarrow a$  then $f(x_n)\rightarrow f(a).$  Any probability function
 has a similar property.
<p></p>

<fieldset>
<legend><b>Definition: Increasing limit</b></legend>
Let $A_1,A_2,...$ be a sequence of events. Let $A$ be
any event. We say that $A_n$'s increase to $A$ (and
write $A_n\nearrow A$) if 
$$A_1\subseteq A_2\subseteq A_3\subseteq\cdots$$
and 
$$A = \cup_n A_n.$$
</fieldset>

<p></p>

<fieldset>
<legend><b>Definition: Decreasing limit</b></legend>
Let $A_1,A_2,...$ be a sequence of events. Let $A$ be
any event. We say that $A_n$'s decrease to $A$ (and
write $A_n\searrow A$) if 
$$A_1\supseteq A_2\supseteq A_3\supseteq \cdots$$
and 
$$A = \cap_n A_n.$$
</fieldset>

<p></p>

<fieldset>
<legend><b><i>Theorem</i></b></legend>
If $A_n\nearrow A$ or $A_n\searrow A$ then $P(A_n)\rightarrow P(A).$ 
</fieldset>

<p>
<b><i>Proof:</i></b>
Let's do the $A_n\nearrow A$ case first. 
<p></p>
Define $B_1=A_1$ and for $n\geq 2$ let $B_n
=A_n\setminus A_{n-1}.$ 
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/rings.png"></th>

</table>
</center>
Then $B_1,B_2,B_3,...$ are all disjoint. <a href="javascript:hideShow('cwh');">(Why? Don't just say
 "obvious!". Write a one line proof.)</a>
<div id="cwh" style="display:none;background-color:#ffcccc;">Take any $i &lt; j.$  Then $B_i\subseteq A_i\subseteq A_j.$  But $B_j\subseteq A_i^c.$  So $B_i\cap B_j=\phi.$</div> 
Also, for $n\in{\mathbb N},$ we have $A_n = B_1\cup\cdots\cup B_n.$
<p></p>
So $A = B_1\cup B_2\cup\cdots.$<a href="javascript:hideShow('wh2');">(Why?)</a>
<div id="wh2" style="display:none;background-color:#ffcccc;">
If $x\in A$  then $x\in A_n$  for some $n\in{\mathbb N}.$  Let $n_0$  be the least $n\in{\mathbb N}$  for which
 $x\in A_{n_0}.$  If $n_0=1,$  then $x\in A_1 = B_1.$  If $n_0&gt;1,$  then $x\in A_{n_0}\setminus A_{n_0-1} = B_{n_0}.$
<p></p>
Hence $A\subseteq \cup B_n.$
<p></p>
Conversely, let $y\in \cup_n B_n.$  Then $y\in A_n\subseteq A.$
<p></p>
So $\cup B_n \subseteq A.$<p></p>
Combining, $\cup B_n = A.$
</div>

<p></p>
Hence, by the third axiom, $P(A) = \sum_1^\infty P(B_i) =
\lim_n \sum_1^n P(B_i) = \lim_n P(A_n),$ as required.
<p></p>

<a href="javascript:hideShow('cont');">The $A_n\searrow A$ case follows on taking complements. 
</a>
<div id="cont" style="display:none;background-color:#ffcccc;">
If $A_n\searrow A$, then $A_n^c\nearrow A^c.$
<p></p>
Hence, by what we have proved, $P(A_n^c)\rightarrow P(A^c),$
<p></p>
or $1-P(A_n)\rightarrow 1-P(A),$ or $P(A_n)\rightarrow P(A),$ as required.
</div>

<p></p>

<b><i>[QED]</i></b>
</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a
name="Inclusion-Exclusion formula">Inclusion-Exclusion formula</a></h3>
Just now we have mentioned the result $P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).$  
We can think of this like 
<blockquote>$P(A)+P(B)$  overestimates $P(A\cup B)$  because the $P(A\cap B)$  part is included
 twice. So we need to exclude it once.</blockquote>
 This idea of inclusion and exclusion works for any finite number of events. 
<p></p>

<fieldset>
<legend><b><i>Inclusion-Exclusion formula</i></b></legend>
Let $A_1,...,A_n$ be any $n$
events. Let $T$ denote the set of all subsets of $\{1,...,n\}.$ Then 
$$P(A_1\cup \cdots \cup A_n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \left[(-1)^{k+1} \sum_{\alpha\in T,|\alpha|=k} P(A_\alpha)\right],$$
where for any $\alpha\subseteq T$ we define 
$$A_\alpha = \cap_{i\in \alpha} A_i.$$
</fieldset>

<p>
<b><i>Proof:</i></b>
The notation is a bit complicated. Let's understand it first with the $n=3$ case. 
Here the first term of the outer sum consists of the sum of all $A_\alpha$  where $\alpha\in T$  
and $|\alpha|=1$  (<i>i.e.</i>, all singleton  subsets of $\{1,2,3\}$). 
This sum is simply 
$$P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3).$$ 
 Similarly, the next term consists of 
all $A_\alpha,$  where $\alpha$  is a doubleton subset of $\{1,2,3\}.$  Remember that 
$A_{\{1,2\}} = A_1\cap A_2$  and so on. So the second term (for $k=2$) becomes 
$$-[P(A_1\cap A_2)+P(A_2\cap A_3)+P(A_1\cap A_3)].$$ 
 The third term (for $k=3$) similarly is 
$P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3).$  So the entire sum looks like 
$$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3) = [P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)]-[P(A_1\cap A_2)+P(A_2\cap A_3)+P(A_1\cap A_3)]+P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3).$$
 The Venn diagram shows why this formula is correct. But a Venn diagram cannot be 
considered as a proof, as it shows only one possible case. However, a Venn diagram does indicate 
how to construct a general proof.
Note that $A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3$ is made of certain disjoint
events:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/ie1.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Cells</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
We have coloured these using blue, green and red. Blue cells
consist of points belonging to exactly one $A_i.$ For
example, $B_1$ is the set of points that belong only
to $A_1.$ The green
cells consist of points belonging to exactly two $A_i$'s,
and so on. So 
$$A_1 =  B_1\cup B_{12}\cup B_{13} \cup B_{123},$$
and similarly for $A_2,$ and $A_3.$ Note the pattern:
all the $B's$ with $1$ somewhere in the subscript has
occurred in the RHS. Since the events in the RHS are
disjoint, so we have 
$$P(A_1) =  P(B_1)+P(B_{12})+P(B_{13})+P(B_{123}).$$
Now, the first stage (inclusion) is
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3) 
&amp; = &amp; [P(B_1)+P(B_{12})+P(B_{13})+P(B_{123})]\\
&amp; &amp; +[P(B_2)+P(B_{12})+P(B_{23})+P(B_{123})]\\
&amp; &amp; +[P(B_3)+P(B_{13})+P(B_{23})+P(B_{123})]
\end{eqnarray*}$$
<p></p>
Note that here each $B$ with a single subscript occurs once,
each $B$ with two subscripts occur twice, and so on. This 
is of course natural, since for example, $B_{12}$ occurs once as
part of $A_1$ and then again as part of $A_2.$
<p></p>
Next, we have 
$$A_{12} =  B_{12}\cup  B_{123}.$$
Here all the $B$'s with $12$ in the subscript occur in
the RHS. Again, since the $B$'s are all disjoint, 
$$
P(A_{12}) =  P(B_{12})+P(B_{123}).
$$
Similarly for $A_{23}$ and $A_{13}.$ Using these, 
the second stage (exclusion) is 
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A_{12})+P(A_{23})+P(A_{13}) 
&amp; = &amp; [P(B_{12})+P(B_{123})]\\
&amp; &amp; +[P(B_{23})+P(B_{123})]\\
&amp; &amp; +[P(B_{13})+P(B_{123})]
\end{eqnarray*}$$
Note that no $B$ with a single subscript occurs at
all. The $B$'s with two subscripts occur once each, while
the $B$ with three subscripts occur thrice. Do you see the
pattern? Each $B$ is like $B_\beta,$ where $\beta$
is a nonempty subset of $\{1,2,3\}.$ Similarly, each $A$ is
like $A_\alpha,$ where $\alpha $ is also a nonempty
subset of $\{1,2,3\}.$ Now $B_\beta$  occurs as a part
of $A_\alpha$ if and only if $\alpha\subseteq \beta.$
So the number of times we see $B_{123}$ in the RHS is same
as the number of subsets of size 2 of $\{1,2,3\},$ which
is $\binom{3}{2}=3.$ The same technique will also explain
why $B_{23},$ for example, occurs only once: the number of
subsets of size 2 of $\{2,3\}$ is $\binom{2}{2}=1.$
In fact, the same approach also explains the absence
of $B$'s with single indices. Each single index $B$
occurs $\binom{1}{2}=0$ times!
<p></p>
The third stage (inclusion) is similar, though
simpler. Here $A_{123} = B_{123},$ and so $P(A_{123}) =
P(B_{123}).$ Our basic pattern holds here also: The
3-index $B$ occurs $\binom33=1$
time. The $2$-index $B$'s occur $\binom23=0$ time,
and the 1-index $B$'s occur $\binom13=0$ time.
<p></p>
The following table gives a summary:

Now we head for the general case for any given $n.$ 
<p></p>
For any $\alpha\in T$ define
<blockquote>
$B_\alpha=$ the set of all those points that belong to $A_i$ iff $i\in \alpha.$
</blockquote>
Clearly, by definition, $B_\alpha$'s are all disjoint and 
$$A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n = \cup_{\alpha\in T} B_\alpha.$$
Now observe that for any $\alpha \in T$
$$A_\alpha = \cup_{\beta\supseteq\alpha} B_\beta.$$
So
$$P(A_\alpha) = \sum_{\beta\supseteq\alpha} P(B_\beta).$$
So the number of times a $k$-index $B$ is considered in the $r$-th
stage is $\binom{k}{r}.$ 
<a href="javascript:hideShow('ie');">(Click here for more explanation.)</a>
<div id="ie" style="display:none;background-color:#ffcccc;">
In the $r$-th stage we are considering the sum
of $P(A_\alpha)$ for all $\alpha$ of size $r.$ 
<p></p>
Fix any $\beta.$
<p></p>
Then $P(B_\beta)$ occurs only for those $P(A_\alpha)$'s
where $\alpha\subseteq\beta.$ 
<p></p>
Thus, $P(B_\beta)$ occurs as many times as there are subsets
of $\beta$ of size $k.$
<p></p>
If $|\beta|=k,$ then this number is $\binom{k}{r}.$
</div>
More precisely, 
$$
\sum_{|\alpha|=r} P(A_\alpha) = \sum_{k=1}^r \binom{k}{r}
\sum_{|\beta|=k} P(B_\beta).
$$
<p></p>
Hence total number of inclusion of a $k$-index $B$ is
$$
\binom{k}{1}-\binom{k}{2}+-\cdots+(-1)^{n+1} \binom{k}{n} = 1-(1-1)^k=1,
$$
using binomial theorem.
<p></p>
Hence every $B$ is included exactly once in the RHS. Thus,
$$
P(\cup_{\alpha\in T}B_\alpha) =  RHS,
$$
as required.
<b><i>[QED]</i></b>
</p>
Notice that the proof has used only the third axiom of probability. 
So if we have any function $P(\cdot)$  that satisfies the third axiom, the theorem is valid for that 
function as well. Examples of such functions include length, area, volume, mass, number of elements (for
 finite sets). In short, it is
 true for any measure of size.
<p></p>
 Indeed, all functions that satisfy  axiom three are called <b>(signed) measure</b>s, and 
meaure theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with them. 
<p></p>

<h2><a
name="Countable sample spaces">Countable sample spaces</a></h2>
If the sample space $S$ is countable (finite/infinite), say 
$$
S = \{x_1,x_2,...\},
$$
then take any sequence $p_1,p_2,...$ of nonnegative numbers
ading up to $1.$ Defining $P(\{x_i\})=p_i$ completely
specifies a probability. Conversely, any probability can be
constructed like this.
<p></p>

<h3><a
name="Equally likely cases">Equally likely cases</a></h3>
The simplest special case is when the sample space $\Omega$ is finite
(say $|\Omega|=n$) and we take $p_1=\cdots=p_n=\frac 1n.$
<p></p>
In this case, for any $A\subseteq \Omega$ we have $P(A) =|A|/|\Omega|.$
<p></p>
Many interesting problems fall in this category. They are
basically problems of combinatorics. One type of problem is
<i>occupancy problems</i>, where we have some boxes and some
balls are distributed over them following various
conditions. 
<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;
There are three distinct boxes and 10 distinct balls. The balls are dropped randomly among the boxes so that all possible
 configurations are equally likely. (No ball is outside a box.) What is the probability that the first box is empty?
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
Each of the 10 balls has 3 possible destinations, irreespective of the other balls. So the total 
number of configurations is $3^{10}.$  So $|\Omega|=3^{10}.$
<p></p>
Let $A$  be the event that the first ball remains empty. Then $A$  occurs if and only if all the balls land in
 the other 2 boxes. So $|A|=2^{10}.$  
<p></p>
Since all outocmes are equally likely hence 
$$P(A)= \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \left(\frac 23\right)^{10}.$$
 ///
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;
Same problem as above, except that the balls are now identical. The boxes are still distinct. 
What is the answer now?
<p></p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b>
By the bar-star argument $|\Omega| = \binom{12}{2}=66.$
<p></p>
Similarly, $|A| = \binom{11}{1} = 11.$
<p></p>
So the answer is $\frac 16.$

<p></p>
Certain real-life scenarios may be modelled like
this. Here are a few examples from physics (no need to cram these
terms for the exams!).
<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;
There are $r$ (identical/distinct) particles. Each particle may be in
one of $n$ distinct states. We can think of the particles as
balls and the states as boxes. For example, if the states are UP
and DOWN, and there are $r=12$ <i>identical</i> particles, among which 5 are
in UP state and 7 in DOWN, we can visualise this as:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/occ1.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
If there are $r=3$ <i>distinct</i> particles and the same two
states, then the picture could be like:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/occ2.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
Physicists assume various types of probabilities on
these. 
<ul>

<li>
<b>Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:</b> The balls are
distinct. Then there are $n^r$ many possible configurations (each
of the $r$ balls has $n$ possible destinations).
All these $n^r$ configurations are assumed equally likely.
No real life particle shows this behaviour.</li>

<p></p>

<li>
<b>Bose-Einstein distribution:</b> The balls are
identical. So, by the bar-star argument, we know that there
are ${n+r-1\choose n-1}$ configurations possible. These are
assumed equally likely.</li>

<p></p>

<li>
<b>Fermi-Dirac distribution:</b> Here $n\geq r$ and no
box can hold more than one ball. Balls are
identical. So ${n\choose r}$ distinct configurations are
possible (since a configuration is determined completely by which
of the boxes have one ball in it). All these 
configurations are assumed equally likely.</li>

</ul>

Often we come across events that easily described in words, but
whose probabilities are rather hard to compute. Computer
simulation comes handy in such cases. Computer simulations help
in detecting theoretical mistakes too. 
<p></p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE ():</b>&nbsp;
A deck of 10 cards labelled 1,...,10 is shuffled thoroughly. We shall
say that the $i$-th card is <i>at home</i>, if it is in
the $i$-th positon after the shuffle. Write an R code to
estimate the probability that exactly 3 cards are at home.
