<HEAD1>How to improve mathematical writings</HEAD1>
Even before we discuss some tips and techniques to improve your
math writing skill, we should better address the main reasons
behind why many students (wrongly) think that this skill is not
very important. 
<HEAD2>Why care?</HEAD2>
There are two excuses that work at the back of our mind
preventing us from trying to improve our math writings.
<UL>
<LI>Most students associate writing with exams. Examiners often
look for some key steps in the solutions, and give marks based
on only that. So guessing the correct answer and somehow lamely
justifying it are enough to secure good marks. </LI>
<LI>Rigourous math writing takes some effort, and more you
concentrate on that the more mechanical you become. Thus rigour
seems to fight intuition, and you lose the charm of ideas
flowing naturally.</LI>
</UL>
Both these points are valid. Let me address the 

<HEAD2>Tips</HEAD2>
<OL>
<LI>Never write a symbol without defining it <I>before</I> its
first use.</LI>
<LI>Never use math connectives loosely. The most commonly abused
connective are <M>\implies</M>, <M>=</M>, <M>\in</M>, <M>\to</M>
and <M>\seq</M>.</LI>
<LI>Mark all sentences as belonging to exacly one of the four
categories below:
<OL>
<LI>An assumption.</LI>
<LI>A known fact.</LI>
<LI>A consequence.</LI>
<LI>A target.</LI>
</OL>
