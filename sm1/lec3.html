<hr/><h1><a
name="Population and sample">Population and sample</a></h1>
The concept of population and sample sits at the heart of how
statistical regularity is used in statistics. 
This key concept in a nutshell is this:
<blockquote> Whatever data we collect is like a
<b>cup of water from a vast ocean</b>. The cup of water is all that we have to
base our inference on, but it is not the water in the cup that we want to
draw inference about.
 The  target of our inference is the entire ocean.</blockquote>
 The
statistical term for the cup of water is a <b>sample</b>, the ocean being
called the <b>population</b>. 
<p></p>
The very term <b>population</b>
conjures up the vision of the totality of all the people living in a
country. While this is indeed a very important example,
statistics uses the term "population" in a broader sense: Suppose
that I toss a coin. Thus is a random experiment that I can repeat
as many times as I like. A statistician likes to think of this as
drawing "head"s and "tail"s from an <i>infinite</i> population
consisting of many, many "head"s and "tail"s. Since the
population is infinite, we cannot really say that the chance of
obtaining a "head" is the total number of heads divided by
the population size. Instead, we pretend that God is handing out
the "head"s and "tail"s randomly with certain
probabilities. The "population" then is not just an infinite set,
it is the entire random experiment.
<p></p>
This approach may appear a bit wierd at first, and may take some
time to digest. But that's how you should learn to think in order
to study statistics.    
<p></p>
The idea if statistics is to repeat the experiment a large number
of times (or, equivalently, to draw a large sample from the
population) and use statistical regularity to learn about the
random experiment (or, equivalently, the population).

<h2><a
name="Basic workflow of statistics">Basic workflow of statistics</a></h2>
Many activities may be considered like a blackbox, we put some
input into it, and get some output out of it. In many cases, the
blackbox is unpredictable, in the sense even when we put in the
same input the output differs unpredictably. Statistics starts by
postulating an ideal form of unpredictablity: a blackbox whose
output is unpreditable, but whose unpredictability may be
repeated as many times as we like. Such ideal blackboxes are
called <b>random experiments</b>. Just like ideal gases, a random
experiment is an idealised concept, that may not exist in
practice. Some of its best approximations are coin toss or die
roll. Next, we try to explain every other blackbox in terms of
one or more random experiments. Much like chemists trying to
explain all chemicals in terms of elements. This is called
<b>statistical modelling</b>. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
If we measure the amount of dust or suspended particulate matter
(SPM) in air everyday in the same location we see random
fluctuations in the values. Clearly, the values are not
independent. Here is one way to statistically model the data: 

<p></p>
Let $\epsilon_t = $ the amount of <i>fresh</i> SPM generated
on day $t.$ We assume $\epsilon_t$'s are IID from some
random experiment. We link these with the observed data as
follows:
$$
X_t = \epsilon_t + \theta_1 X_{t-1} + \theta_2 X_{t-2}.
$$
Thishas  the interpretation that the amount of SPM is partly due to
the residual SPM from the last two days plus the fresh SPM
generated today. The constants $\theta_1$
and $\theta_2$ are the fractions determining how much the
SPM of the last two days influence today's SPM. 

<p></p>
This model has three unknowns: the random experiment from which
the $\epsilon_t$'s were generated, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2.$

<p></p>
The job of the statistician is to collect lots of $X_t$'s
(<i>i.e.</i>, measure $X_t$'s over many days) and then somehow use
statistical regularity to find these unknown quantities. 
 ///
</p>

From where did we get this model? Is there any theory that SPM
indeed behaves in this way? Not really. It is just a model, a
mathematically simple way to approximate the random behaviour
of $X_t$'s. In statistics we start by assuming some such
model, and estimate the unknown quantities based on the
data. Then we compare the actual data with the fitted model. If
the fitted model exlains the behaviour of the data well, then we
are happy, else we look for some other model. 


<p></p>
This is much like fitting a polynomial to a scatterplot. We start
by fitting a straight line: $y = \alpha + \beta x,$ <i>i.e.</i>, by
choosing the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta $ that gives
the best possible fit (according to some suitable criteria). Then
we draw this best line on the scatterplot, and decide if it is a
good fit. The <i>best</i> fit need not be a <i>good</i> fit, just
as the best swimmer in India is not a good swimmer according to
the Olympic standard. If our best fitting line is indeed a good fit, we
are happy. Otherwise we look for a different model, say all
polynomials of the form $\alpha + \beta x + \gamma x^2.$
Again, the same titual follows: we pick those values for the
parameters $\alpha$, $\beta $ and $\gamma$ that
give the best fit (within this class of models), and check its goodness-of-fit.
<p></p>
This is the general statistical workflow:
<ol type="">

<li>Decide upon a goodness-of-fit criterion.</li>

<li>Pick a (class of) models.</li>

<li>Pick the best fitting member of that class.</li>

<li>Check it's goodness-of-fit.</li>

<li>If you are happy, then use it for prediction etc. If
unhappy, pick another class of models, and repeat.</li>

<li>Give up, when you are bored!</li>

</ol>
A remarkably wide range of models may be used in step 2
above. But remember that your aim is to get a good fit, and not
merely to showcase your modelling prowess! Getting a good fit is
usually not easy, even with creative choces for the class of
models.

<h2><a
name="What if more than one model gives comparably good
fits?">What if more than one model gives comparably good
fits?</a></h2>
Then we choose one among them according to the following three
basic guidelines:
<ol type="">

<li>domain knowledge</li>

<li>parsimony</li>

<li>interpretability</li>

</ol>


<h3><a
name="Domain knowledge">Domain knowledge</a></h3>
Statistics just deals with numbers, without caring for the story
behind them. Consider the experiment for Boyle's law. Here we get
different values for volume (V) for different values of pressure
(P). The scatterplot shows a decreasing  trend.
<center>
<fieldset>
<legend><b>Part of Boyle's original data</b></legend><img width="80%" src="image/pv.png"></fieldset>
</center>
Both a straightline and a rectangular hyperbola may appear to be a
good fit.  But a straightline is obviously impossible once you
recall that you cannot make the volume negative by applying a bit
of extra pressure! 
 

<h3><a
name="Parsimony">Parsimony</a></h3>
"Parsimony" means "miserliness" (being unwilling to spend
money). Sometimes we see that two models producing comparably
good fits are of different levels of complexity. Then we
naturally choose the one thatis simpler. This is the principle of
parsimony. It is also called Occam's razor principle. 


<h3><a
name="Interpretability">Interpretability</a></h3>
Statistics works closely with our everyday life, and unlike most
other walks of science, it involves dealing with lay people.
Nobody minds if you come up with a most complicated formula to
explain lunar motion, but when you want to give a formula for
deciding the optimal amount of fertliser based on soil type, your
formula will be used by farmers, and a complicated formula may
just go unheeded. So we prefer models that are easily
interpretable.
