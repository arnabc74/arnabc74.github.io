<HEAD2>Reference materials</HEAD2>
The lecture notes are the main reference materials. You should also
take a look at  the following  books. The lectures
will <I>not</I>  follow the books. 
<DL>
<DT><B>Statistics</B> by <I>Witte and Witte</I></DT>
<DD>The book that is closest to being our main textbook. It is an
easy-going book, not too ambitious.</DD>

<DT><B>Statistics</B> by <I>Freedman, Pisani and Purves</I></DT>
<DD>This book is a thought-provoking one. It has ideas and open
questions. Not a regular textbook, but a welcome change from the
world of classroom lectures.</DD>

<DT><B>How to Lie with Statistics</B> by <I>Huff</I></DT>
<DD>A fun book, as its name suggests. Contains cartoons, and some
valuable insights. A must read, when you get bored!</DD>
</DL>

We shall
use the R environment (language plus libraries)   for all our computation. If you know Python,
that`s great, but please also learn R. We shall need only only a small
subset of features of R, that we shall discuss and demonstrate
in class. The following  books are for optional self-reading.
<DL>
<DT><B><LINK to="arnabRtut.pdf">A short R tutorial</LINK></B></DT>
<DD>I put together this little tutorial to get you started in
R. It has some things for you to type and watch the outputs to
explore R.</DD>

<DT><B>R for Everyone</B> by <I>Lander</I></DT>
<DD>An introduction to the R language and environment. </DD>


<DT><B>The Art of R Programming</B> by <I>Matloff</I></DT>
<DD>Another introductory book for  R.</DD>
