 technically speaking, we have to 
avoid the "bad" subsets. This is how we do it.

Let <M>X:\Omega\to\rr</M>  be any random variable. Let <M>f:\rr\to\rr</M>  be any Borel-mesurable function, i.e., if <M>B\in {\mathcal B}</M> 
 then <M>f^{-1}(B)\in {\mathcal B}.</M>  Then <M>f(X)</M>  is again a random variable. Remember that <M>f(X)</M>  actually
 means the composition function <M>(f\circ X):\Omega\to\rr.</M>
