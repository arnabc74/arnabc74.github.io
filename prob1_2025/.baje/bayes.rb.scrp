An SRSWOR is always less informative than an SRSWR of the same size. So you should use WOR
 for the second draw. Also, given any particular outcome <M>X</M>(=RR, RB, BR or BB), you should
 compute <M>P(\mbox{urn }A|X)</M>  and <M>P(\mbox{urn }B|X)</M>  and guess the urn that has the
 greater conditional probability.
