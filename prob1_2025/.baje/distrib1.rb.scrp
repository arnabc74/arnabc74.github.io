Let <M>X_i</M>  be indicator for there being a changeover at position <M>i</M>  for <M>i=2,...,n.</M>  By definition, there
 cannot be a changeover at <M>i=1.</M>  

Then the answer is <M>\sum_2^n E(X_i). </M>  Now <M>X_i = 1</M>  iff the <M>(i-1)</M>-th and
 <M>i</M>-th tosses result in either <M>HT</M>  or <M>TH.</M>  

So <M>E(X_i) = \cdots.</M>
