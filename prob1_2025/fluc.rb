A drunkard stands at some integer on a number line. At each step he moves
either left or right to the adjacent number. He chooses the left
or right with equal probability. 
Let <M>S_n</M> be his position after <M>n</M> steps,
for <M>n=0,...,10.</M> We may draw a graph of <M>S_n</M>
versus <M>n</M> using a zigzag line like the one shown below.

Clearly, there are <M>2^{10}</M> such possible paths. Since the
man is a drunkard we assume that all these are equally likely. 

<EXM>
Find the probability that he ends up at his starting position
after 10 steps.<SOLN/>
It is the
total number of paths from <M>(0,0)</M> to <M>(10,0)</M> divided
by <M>2^{10}.</M> Now, each such path must have the same number
of up's and down's. So the number is <M>\binom{10}{5}.</M> 
</EXM>


::<EXR>Find the probability that the drunkard ends up at any given
<M>k\in\zz</M> in exactly <M>n</M> steps.</EXR>

<HEAD2>Notation</HEAD2>
Any path from time <M>m</M> to <M>n</M> (with <M>m<n</M>)
will be considered as a function <M>\pi:\{m,...,n\}\to\zz.</M> 
If, for example,
the path passes through some <M>(3,4)</M> then we
have <M>\pi(3)=4.</M>

The set of all paths from a point <M>\alpha</M> to a
point <M>\beta</M> will be denoted by <M>PATH(\alpha,\beta).</M>
For example, if <M>\alpha = (0,0)</M> and <M>\beta = (5,2)</M>,
then we have 
<Q>
<M>PATH(\alpha,\beta) = \{\pi:\{0,...,5\}\to\zz~:~\pi(0)=0,~\pi(5)=2\}.</M>
</Q>

<DEFN name="Number of paths">
Let the number of paths from <M>(0,0)</M> to <M>(n,x)</M> be
denoted by <M>N_{n,x}.</M> In other words,
<D>
N_{n,x} = |PATH(#((0,0), (n,x))#)|.
</D>
In particular,  <M>N_{0,0}=1.</M>
</DEFN>

<THM>
<D>
N_{n,x} = \binom{n}{[[n+x][2]]}.
</D>
This is <M>0</M> if <M>[[n+x][2]]</M> is
outside <M>\{0,1,...,n\}.</M>
</THM>

<EXM>
Find <M>|PATH(#( (2,3), (15,2) )#)|.</M>
<SOLN/>
Any path from <M>PATH(#( (2,3), (15,2) )#)</M> may be shifted 2
units to the left and 3 units downwards to arrive at a path
in <M>PATH(#( (0,0), (13,-1) )#).</M> 
<CIMG web="shift.png">The red path is shifted to the blue path.</CIMG>
This shift establishes a
bijection between <M>PATH(#( (0,0), (13,-1) )#)</M>
and <M>PATH(#( (2,3), (15,2) )#).</M> So they have the same
size. Hence the answer is <M>N_{13,-1} = \binom{13}{6}.</M> 
</EXM>
Similar argument leads to the following theorem.

<THM>
<M>|PATH(#( (a,p),(b,q) )#)| = N_{b-a,q-p}.</M>
</THM>



<EXM>
Consider all paths of length <M>2n</M> starting from <M>(0,0).</M>
What is the probability that the path returns 
to <M>0</M> at time <M>2n</M>?
<SOLN/>
There are <M>2^{2n}</M> paths, all equally likely. So <M>|\Omega| =
2^{2n}.</M> 
<P/>
Let <M>A</M> be the event that the path ends at <M>(2n,0).</M>
<P/>
Then <M>|A| = N_{2n,0}.</M>
<P/>
So <M>P(A) = [[|A|][|\Omega|]] =  
[[N_{2n,0}][2^{2n}]].
</M>
</EXM>

::<EXR>
Find the numerical value of the probability you found in the
above example for <M>n=5.</M> Check it by running the following
code:
<RC>
event = c() 
for(k in 1:5000) {
  x = sample(c(-1,1), 10, rep=T)
  event[k] = (sum(x)==0)
}
mean(event)
</RC>
</EXR>


Since we are assuming that all paths in the sample space are
equally likely, computing probabilities of different events
amounts to finding the size of the events (i.e., counting the
number of paths in the event). So the theorems are presented in
terms of sizes of events rather than in terms of their probabilities. 

<COMMENT>
We shall start with a discrete version of the intermediate value
theorem. See the following diagram.
<CIMG web="inter.png">The path meets the horizontal line twice.</CIMG>
Here we have taken a horizontal line at an integer height and two points on two sides
of it. Then any path between these two points must meet this
horizontal line somewhere.

Let <M>m, n, a, b, L</M>  be integers with <M>m<n</M>

In the diagram above either <M>t_1</M> or <M>t_2</M> may be

<HEAD2>Reflection principle</HEAD2>
Our aim here is to find probabilities of various sets of paths, or, equivalently to find the sizes of
of these sets. We can often express them easily using the <M>N_{n,r}</M> notation.
This is thanks to the <I>reflection principle</I>,  which we discuss now.

Draw the horizontal line at  height <M>5,</M>  say. Consider two
points <M>\alpha=(2,6)</M>  and <M>\beta=(6,4)</M>, say, that are  on the <I>same</I>
side of the line.
<CIMG web="reflmot.png"></CIMG>
 We want to count the number of paths from <M>\alpha</M>  to <M>\beta</M>  that 
 meets (i.e., touches or cuts) <M>L.</M>  One such path is shown in the diagram. 

To find this number we employ a trick. 
Let
 <M>\alpha'</M> be the reflection
of <M>\alpha</M> along <M>L.</M> Thus here, <M>\alpha' = (2,4).</M>  
Then the required number 
the same as <M>|PATH(\alpha',\beta)|.</M>

<BOX name="Reflection principle">
Draw any horizontal line <M>L</M> at an integer height. Pick any two
points <M>\alpha:(m,p)</M> and <M>\beta:(n,q)</M> with <M>m<n</M> on the same
side of the line (<M>m,n,p,q\in\zz</M>). Let <M>\alpha'</M> be the reflection
of <M>(m,p)</M> around <M>L.</M> Then the number of paths
from <M>\alpha</M>
to <M>\beta</M> that meets (i.e., touches or cuts) <M>L</M> is <M>|PATH(\alpha',\beta)|.</M>
</BOX>
<PF>
Keep an eye on this picture while reading the proof:
<CIMG web="refl.png">Reflection principle</CIMG>
Let <M>S</M> be the set of all paths from <M>\alpha </M>
to <M>\beta </M> that meets <M>L.</M> 
<P/>
Shall show that <M>|S|=|PATH(\alpha',\beta)|.</M>
<P/>
Enough to show that there is a bijection  <M>f:S\to PATH(\alpha',\beta).</M>

<B>Step 1: Constructing <M>f</M></B>:

Take any path <M>p\in S.</M> Let <M>\gamma</M> be the first point where the
path meets <M>L.</M>

Reflect around <M>L</M> the part of the path
between <M>\alpha</M> and <M>\gamma.</M> This will give a path
from <M>\alpha'</M> to <M>\beta.</M> Define <M>f(p)</M> to be
this path.

We shall now show that it is a bijection. The following diagram is an example showing the effect of this map:
<CIMG web="reflecexm.png">The purple part is reflected</CIMG>
<P/><B>Step 2: Showing onto</B>:
<P/>
Take any <M>q\in PATH(\alpha',\beta).</M> Since <M>\alpha'</M> and <M>\beta</M> are
on opposite sides of <M>L,</M> so the path must
intersect <M>L</M> some time or other. 

Let <M>\gamma</M> be the
first such point. Reflect the part of <M>q</M> between <M>\alpha'</M> and <M>\gamma </M> to get a path <M>p\in S.</M>
Clearly <M>f(p)=q.</M> 
<P/><B>Step 3: Showing one-one</B>:
<P/>
Let <M>p_1,p_2\in S</M> be such that <M>f(p_1)=f(p_2)=q,</M>
say. Shall
show that <M>p_1=p_2.</M>
<P/>
Pick the first point <M>\gamma</M> where <M>q</M> meets <M>L.</M>
Then by property of <M>f</M>, the part of <M>q</M>
from <M>\gamma</M> to <M>\beta</M> is the same as the part
of <M>p_1</M> from <M>\gamma</M> to <M>\beta.</M> 
<P/>
Similarly,  the part of <M>q</M>
from <M>\gamma</M> to <M>\beta</M> is the same as the part
of <M>p_2</M> from <M>\gamma</M> to <M>\beta.</M> 

<P/>
So <M>p_1</M> matches <M>p_2</M> between <M>\gamma </M> and <M>\beta.</M>
<P/>
Also, the part of <M>p_1</M> from <M>\alpha</M> to <M>\gamma</M>
is the reflection of the part of <M>q</M> from <M>\alpha'</M> to <M>\gamma.</M>
<P/>
Similarly, the part of <M>p_2</M> from <M>\alpha</M> to <M>\gamma</M>
is the reflection of the part of <M>q</M> from <M>\alpha'</M> to <M>\gamma.</M>
<P/>
So <M>p_1</M> matches <M>p_2</M> between <M>\alpha</M> and <M>\gamma.</M>
<P/>
Hence <M>p_1=p_2,</M> as required.
</PF>


<EXM>
Again take a horizontal line <M>L</M> (at height <M>h</M>) and two
points <M>A:(a,p)</M> and <M>B:(b,q)</M> both above (not on)
<M>L.</M> Here <M>a<b.</M> How many paths are there
from <M>A</M> to <M>B</M> that does <I>not</I> meet <M>L?</M> 
<SOLN/>
First count all paths from <M>A</M> to <M>B.</M> From it subtract
the number of paths that meet <M>L.</M>
<P/>
Total number of paths from <M>A</M> to <M>B</M>
is <M>N_{b-a,q-p}.</M>

<P/>

The number of paths from <M>A</M> to <M>B</M> that
meet <M>L</M> may be found using the <B>reflection principle</B>.
<P/>
The reflection of <M>A</M> along <M>L</M> is at <M>A':(a,2h-p).</M> 

<P/>
So the required number is <M>N_{b-a,q-2h+p}.</M>
<P/>
Hence the final answer is <M>N_{b-a,q-p}-N_{b-a,q-2h+p}.</M>
</EXM>

<EXM>
How many paths are there from <M>(0,0)</M> to <M>(10,4)</M> that
are strictly positive at all times <M>>0?</M>

<SOLN/>
This is very similar to the exercise above (with <M>L</M> given
by the horizontal line at height <M>0</M>), except that we start
on the line itself. 
<P/>
However, it is obvious that our path must go to <M>(1,1)</M>
after the first step. So the last exercise may be applied
between <M>A:(1,1)</M> and <M>B:(10,4).</M>
</EXM>
<HEAD2>Applications of the reflection principle</HEAD2>
Now we shall look at three theorems that are corolaries to the reflection principle. These are:
<UL><LI>the first passage theorem</LI>
<LI>the maximum theorem</LI>
<LI>the no 0-return theorem</LI>
</UL>
These names, by the way, are not standard. 

<HEAD3>First passage theorem</HEAD3>
<EXM>
How many paths are there from <M>(0,0)</M> to <M>(6,2)</M> that do not attain the value <M>2</M> 
 before time 6? Pictorially,  we are counting  paths like the second one in the following diagram. 
<CIMG web="first.png">(a) Does not end at <M>(6,2).</M> (b)
OK. (c) Attains 2 before times 6.</CIMG>
<SOLN/>
Notice that any valid path must pass through <M>(5,1)</M>, and
you have no choice about the last segment (it must be upwards).  So we are
 counting all paths from
 <M>(0,0)</M>  to <M>(5,1)</M>   not
 meeting the horizontal line at 6. 

The answer may now be obtained easily using the reflection principle.
</EXM>
This logic immediately leads to the next theorem.
<THM name="First passage theorem">
Consider all paths of length <M>n</M> starting at <M>(0,0).</M>
Let <M>r\in\{1,...,n\}.</M> Then the number of paths that attain
height <M>r</M> for the first time at time <M>n</M> is 
<D>
N_{n-1,r-1}-N_{n-1,r+1}.
</D>
</THM>
First let us look at some sample paths for <M>n=6</M> and <M>r=2:</M>
<PF>
Such a path must pass through <M>(n-1,r-1)</M> and <M>(n,r).</M>
Also it must never meet the the line at height <M>r</M> up to and
including time <M>n-1.</M>
<P/>
By reflection principle the path up to time <M>n-1</M> may be
chosen in <M>N_{n-1,r-1}-N_{n-1,r+1}</M> ways. The step from
time <M>n-1</M> to <M>n</M> is forced (it has to move up). 
<P/>
Hence the result.
</PF>


<HEAD3>Maximum theorem</HEAD3>
Here is another application of the reflection principle.
<EXM>
How many paths are there from <M>(0,0)</M>  to <M>(11,1)</M>  that have maximum height
 <M>4</M> (i.e., touches 4, but does not cross it)?
<CIMG web="max.png"></CIMG>
<SOLN/>
Find the number of paths from (0,0) to (11,1) that meet 4 (may or may not cross it). This is easy to compute using the reflection
 principle. The answer is <M>N_{11,7}.</M>

Next find similarly 
the number of paths from (0,0) to (11,1) that meet 5 (may or may not cross it). The answer is <M>N_{11,9}.</M>

The difference should give you the answer: <M>N_{11,7}-N_{11,9}.</M>
 </EXM>

<EXM>
How many paths of length 11 are there from <M>(0,0)</M>   that have maximum height
 <M>4</M>?
<SOLN/>
This is very much like the last problem, except that the final height is not specified. Clearly the final height is something
 <M>\leq 4.</M>  and <M>\geq -11.</M>  

Find the number of all such paths with each of these final heights, and add. Don't worry, the sum is telescopic, and a massive
 cancellation will save computational labour. 
</EXM>
<THM name="Maximum theorem">
Consider all paths of length <M>n</M> starting from <M>(0,0).</M>
Let <M>r\in\{0,...,n\}.</M> Then 
the number of paths with maximum <M>r</M> is <M>N_{n,r}</M>
if <M>n,r</M> have the same parity, and <M>N_{n,r+1}</M> else.
</THM>
<PF>
We need to  find the number of paths with maximum <M>r.</M>

Let <M>A</M> be the set of all such paths. 
<P/>
We shall split this set
based on where the path ends. Clearly, it can end somewhere <M>\leq r.</M>
<P/>
Fix any <M>k\leq r.</M> 

Let  <M>B_k=</M>set of all <M>n</M>-length paths with maximum <M>r</M> and ending at
<M>k.</M>

Instead of working with <M>B_k</M>'s directly, we prefer to work with
<Q><M>C=</M> the set of all paths with <RED>maximum <M>\geq
r</M></RED> and ending at <M>k</M></Q>
and
<Q><M>D=</M> the set of all paths with <RED>maximum <M>\geq
r+1</M></RED> and ending at <M>k</M></Q>


Then we can compute <M>|C|</M>  and <M>|D|</M>   easily, and also use the fact
that <M>|B_k| = |C|-|D|.</M>


Now <M>|C|=N_{n,2r-k}</M> and <M>|D|=N_{n,2(r+1)-k}= N_{n,2r-k+2}</M>  by the <B>reflection principle</B>. 

So
<D>
|B_k|=N_{n,2r-k} - N_{n,2r-k+2}.
</D>
We shall now sum this over <M>k\in\{-n,..., r\}</M> to obtain <M>|A|</M>:
<D>A=\sum_{k=-n}^r (N_{n,2r-k} - N_{n,2r-k+2}).</D>
The sum
has a two-step telescoping structure: each negative term
cancels the positive term two steps ahead. 
So only the first halves of the first two terms survive, i.e., <M>N_{n,r}+N_{n,r+1}.</M>

We know that <M>N_{a,b}</M> is 0 if <M>a,b</M> have opposite
parities. Hence the result.
</PF>


<HEAD3>No 0-return theorem</HEAD3>
<THM name="No 0-return theorem">
Consider all paths of length <M>2n</M> starting
at <M>(0,0)</M>. The number of these paths
that never return to <M>0</M> is <M>N_{2n,0}.</M>
</THM>
<PF>
Such a path must either always be positive. Or always be
negative. Clearly, the number of all-positive paths is the same
as that of all-negative paths.
<P/>
An all-positive path must visit <M>(1,1)</M> immediately
after <M>(0,0).</M> So enough to compute the number of
all-positive paths starting from <M>(1,1).</M>
<P/>
Where can such a path end? It can end at <M>2r</M> for
some <M>r\in\{1,...,n\}.</M>

<P/>
By the <B>reflection principle</B>, 
the total number of all-positive paths from <M>(1,1)</M>
to <M>(2n,2r)</M> is 
<D>|PATH(#((1,1),(2n,2r))#)|-|PATH(#((1,-1),(2n,2r))#)|,</D> 
 i.e., <M>N_{2n-1,2r-1}-N_{2n-1,2r+1}.</M>

<P/>
So the total number of all-positive paths is the telescoping sum
<D>
(N_{2n-1,1}-N_{2n-1,3}) +
(N_{2n-1,3}-N_{2n-1,5}) + \cdots + (N_{2n-1,2n-1}-N_{2n-1,2n+1})
= N_{2n-1,1}-N_{2n-1,2n+1} = N_{2n-1,1},
</D>
since <M>N_{2n-1,2n+1}=0</M> (<M>\because 2n+1 > 2n-1</M>).
<P/>

Combining all-positive and all-negative paths, the total count is
<M>2N_{2n-1,1} =
2\binom{2n-1}{n}=[[2(2n-1)!][(n-1)!n!]] =[[(2n!)][n!n!]]
=\binom{2n}{n} = N_{2n,0}.</M>
</PF>
Isn't this surprising? The number of <M>2n</M>-length paths never returning to 0
equals the number of <M>2n</M>-length paths ending at 0. Could you prove it directly by establishing a bijection between
 these two sets of paths?

<COMMENT>
<THEAD2>Positive duration theorem</THEAD2>
We shall now consider the amount of time a path spends in the

Note that <M>k=n</M> means the path is always above the <M>x</M>-axis (though it may touch the
 axis). We shall convert it bijectively into a <M>(2n+1)</M>-length  positive path not returning to
 0. This conversion is done by
 shifting the path 1 unit upwards and to the right, and joining <M>(0,0)</M>  with <M>(1,1).</M>  Click on the figure below
 to see the conversion as an animation.
<VID src="anim.webm"></VID>
The number of <M>(2n+1)</M>-length paths not returning to 0 is twice  the number of <M>2n</M>-length paths not returning

Do you see <HIDE lab="newwhy"><MSG>why</MSG><HIDDEN>
If the first 0-return from positive side is later than <M>2k,</M>  then we have already spent more
 than <M>2k</M>  time units above the <M>x</M>-axis. Similarly, if the first 0-return is later
 than <M>2n-2k</M>  from the negative side, then we have less than <M>2k</M>  time units left, and
 we have not spent any time above the <M>x</M>-axis yet!</HIDDEN></HIDE> it is
 enough to take <M>r</M>  up
 to <M>k</M>  in the first
 union, and up to <M>n-k</M>
  in the second?</LI></UL>

Thus 
<D>|A_{2n,2k}| = \sum_{r=1}^k |A_{2n,2k}\cap B_{2n,2r}| + \sum_{r=1}^{n-k} |A_{2n,2k}\cap C_{2n,2r}|.</D>
Now we shall find <M>|A_{2n,2k}\cap B_{2n,2r}|</M>  and <M>|A_{2n,2k}\cap C_{2n,2r}|</M>  separately. 

The paths in <M>A_{2n,2k}\cap B_{2n,2r}</M>  are positive up to time <M>2r</M>, when they return to 0 for the first time,
 and then during the remaining <M>2n-2r</M>  times units  spend exactly <M>2k-2r</M>  time units in the positive side.

<CIMG web="postep.png">A typical path in <M>A_{12,8}\cap B_{12,6}.</M></CIMG>
 So
 <D>|A_{2n,2k}\cap B_{2n,2r}| = \underbrace{|B_{2r,2r}|}_{\small red}\times
 \underbrace{|A_{2n-2r,2k-2r}|}_{\small green}.</D>
<ALERT/>This is the crucial step. Take time to understand it! 

Similarly
 <D>|A_{2n,2k}\cap C_{2n,2r}| = |C_{2r,2r}|\times |A_{2n-2r,2k}|.</D>
Combining these two we get
 <D>|A_{2n,2k}| =  \sum_{r=1}^k |B_{2r,2r}|\times |A_{2n-2r,2k-2r}|+ \sum_{r=1}^{n-k}|C_{2r,2r}|\times |A_{2n-2r,2k}|.</D>
Notice that <M>|B_{2r,2r}|</M>  and <M>|C_{2r,2r}|</M>  are the same, and each is equal to
 <M>[[12]]|Z_{2r}|,</M>  where <M>Z_{2r} = </M>  number of <M>2r</M>-length paths with first 0-return
 at <M>2r.</M>  Thus, we get our <RED>master equality</RED>:
 <D>|A_{2n,2k}| = [[12]] \sum_{r=1}^k |Z_{2r}|\times |A_{2n-2r,2k-2r}|+ [[12]]\sum_{r=1}^{n-k}|Z_{2r}|\times |A_{2n-2r,2k}|.</D>
Since <M>|Z_{2r}|</M>  is already known from the <B>first 0-return theorem</B>,
this equality expresses <M>A_{2n,2k}</M>  in terms of <M>A_{a,b}</M>'s with <M>a < 2n.</M>
 This suggests that we should try induction on the path length.  

We shall use induction on <M>n</M> to prove the statement 
<D>S(n)~:~\forall k\in\{1,...,n-1\}~~|A_{2n,2k}|=N_{2k,0}\times N_{2n-2k,0}.</D>
Here <M>n=2,3,4,...</M>  

The following diagram shows the possible <M>(n,k)</M>  pairs as dots. The red dots were already dealt
 with in <B>case 1</B>.   
<CIMG web="basis.png">Each dot represents one  <M>(n,k)</M>  pair.</CIMG>
We are applying induction for the blue dots only. <M>S(n)</M>  is the combined statement for all the
blue dots in the <M>n</M>-th
 row. The basis corresponds to the topmost blue dot.
 
<B>Basis</B>: Here <M>n=2</M>  and <M>k=1.</M>   Do this case yourself by direct counting. There
 should be exactly 4 such paths.   


<B>Hypothesis</B>: Assume <M>S(n)</M>  for <M>n=2,...,m-1.</M>  

<B>Step</B>: Shall show for <M>n=m.</M>

Take any <M>k\in\{1,...,n-1\}.</M>

From the <RED>master equality</RED>, the required number is 
 <D>|A_{2n,2k}| = [[12]] \sum_{r=1}^k |Z_{2r}| N_{2k-2r,0}N_{2n-2k,0}+ [[12]]\sum_{r=1}^{n-k}|Z_{2r}| N_{2k,0}N_{2n-2k-2r,0}.</D>
Move the <M>r</M>-free terms  out of the summations:
 <D>|A_{2n,2k}| = [[12]] N_{2n-2k,0}\sum_{r=1}^k |Z_{2r}| N_{2k-2r,0}+ [[12]]N_{2k,0}\sum_{r=1}^{n-k}|Z_{2r}| N_{2n-2k-2r,0}.</D>
Of course, you can now use the formula for <M>|Z_{2r}|</M>  from the <B>first 0-return theorem</B> and
start algebraic manipulations. 
<HIDE lab="spl1"><MSG>But can you see directly that the
first sum is just <M>N_{2k,0}?</M> 
</MSG><HIDDEN>
The <M>r</M>-th sumand is (the number of <M>2r</M> length paths
with first 0-return at <M>2r</M>) <M>\times</M> (the number
of <M>2k-2r</M> paths starting and finishing at height 0). This
product is the number of <M>2r+(2k-2r)=2k</M> length paths
starting and ending at height 0 with
first 0-return at <M>2r.</M>
<P/>
Since we are summing over all possible values of <M>r</M>, the
sum is the number of <M>2k</M> length paths starting and ending
at height 0. This is precisely <M>N_{2k,0}.</M>
</HIDDEN></HIDE>
Similarly,<HIDE lab="spl2"><MSG> what is the second

<M>N_{2n-2k,0}.</M>

This immediately leads to
