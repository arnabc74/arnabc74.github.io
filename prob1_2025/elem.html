<h1 xmlns=""><a
name="Elementary concepts">Elementary concepts</a></h1>
Toss a coin. You can't be sure whether it will come up head first
or tail first. Wait, is that true? After all, the coin is
governed by the laws of physics. So if you know its initial
position, the force of the toss, friction of the air, the nature
of the surface where it will land,  etc etc,
then you <i>should</i> know exactly what it going to
happen. Yes! That's what physics tells you. But the truth is that
in reality we do <i>not</i> have all those pieces of
information. <table align="right" width="20%" border="1">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="pink">A magician-turned-mathematician named <a href="refs/headswithJ.pdf">Persi Diaconis</a> has so much control on
his fingers, that he can make the coin come up whichever way he
likes! He once constructed a mechanical coin
tossing machine that could be controlled to produce any desired
outcome!</td>
</tr>
</table> So we say that the outcome of the coin toss
is <i>random</i>. The adjective random actually is not a property
of of the outcome, it is more about <i>our</i> ignorance behind
the procedure generating it.
<p></p>
Probability theory is the branch of science dealing with
randomness. Just as biology is the branch of science dealing with
living form, and chemistry is the branch dealing with materials
things are made of. 
<p></p>
But there is a great conceptual difference between traditional
branches like biology and chemistry, and probability theory. The
aims of those branches are clear even to a layman. But what
exactly do we mean when we say that we study randomness? The
answer is not at all obvious! 
<p></p>
Let's do a little experiment to get an idea. 
<p></p>

<p></p>
We take four pieces of paper and write the following formulae
on them:
<ol type="">

<li>
$X_{new} = 0.8 X_{old}+0.1$
<p></p>
$Y_{new} = 0.8 Y_{old}+0.04$
</li>

<li>
$X_{new} = 0.5 X_{old}+0.25$
<p></p>
$Y_{new} = 0.5 Y_{old}+0.4$
</li>

<li>
$X_{new} = 0.355 X_{old}-0.355Y_{old}+0.266$
<p></p>
$Y_{new} = 0.355 X_{old}+0.355 Y_{old}+0.078$
</li>

<li>
$X_{new} = 0.355 X_{old}+0.355Y_{old}+0.378$
<p></p>
$Y_{new} = -0.355 X_{old}+0.355 Y_{old}+0.434$
</li>

</ol>
These are all formulae to compute two numbers, $X_{new}$
and $Y_{new}$ from two other numbers $X_{old}$
and $Y_{old}.$ 
<p></p>
We shall play a game of Ludo with these! The Ludo board will be
${\mathbb R}^2,$ and the counter will be a single point, which is
initially at $(X,Y)=(0,0).$ Draw one of the four pieces of
paper at random and apply the formula on it to compute the new
position of the counter. Keep on doing this. A every step you are
drawing one of the four papers at random (same paper may get
picked many times). All the counter positions are marked as
dots.
<p></p>
So after you have played this game for, say, 10000 times, you
have as many dots on the paper. What will these dots look like? A
random jumble? A circle? A line? or what?
<p></p>
Play this game <i>now</i> by clicking <a href="https://arnab-chakraborty.shinyapps.io/shny">here</a>. 
<p></p>

<p></p>
You'll be surprised by the outcome. Somehow all the randomness
has vanished, and a very regular pattern has emerged!
<p></p>
How? Will this always happen? What if I change those formulae? 
<p></p>
These are the questions that probability theory wants to answer.
<p></p>
This "regular pattern out of randomness" phenomenon has a
name. It is called <b>Statistical Regularity</b>.
<p></p>

<h2><a
name="Statistical Regularity">Statistical Regularity</a></h2>
Statistical regularity is different from mathematical patterns in
the sense that it is rarely exactly replicated, it is extremely
similar but not the same. We see this all around us. Our finger
prints, for example, or the leaves on a tree. Statistical
regularity is like a mysterious black box which takes random
unpredictable input and somehow digests the randomness to produce
regular output. No doubt, if we can master this technique then it
should help the predictable output from unpredictable inputs!
The quite predictable profit of the Casino owner or insurance
companies are examples.
<p></p>

<p></p>
Statistical regularity takes many forms, some
more dramatic, some less.  The simplest occurrence of the
phenomenon was first proved mathematically by Jakob 
Bernoulli. We shall learn it in this course. The theorem and its proof will hardly fill a page
completely. But it took 25 years to figure out how to tackle
randomness using mathematics to arrive at the proof!
<p></p>
Welcome to the world of probability!
<p></p>

<h1><a
name="Computer simulation">Computer simulation</a></h1>
Random experiments sit at the heart of probability theory. The
theory actually tries to predict what you are going to see if you
repeat a random experiment a <i>large</i> number of
times. Unfortunately, even a simple random experiment like a coin
toss is difficult to be repeated many times by hand. So we shall
use a computer to carry out a random experiment. We shall use a software
called R, which is particularly easy to use for this
purpose. Also, it is free and easy to install. You can even run
it on the cloud from your smart phone without installing
anything!
<h2><a
name="SRSWR">SRSWR</a></h2>
Consider a fair die roll. It is like randomly drawing one out of 6 pieces of paper
with 1,2,...,6 written on them. Since you give each piece an
equal chance, we call it <b>simple random sampling (SRS)</b>. The
R code for this is 
<font color="red">
<pre>
sample(6,1)
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
sample(6,1)
`));"/>
The first 6 refers to the number of pieces of paper (R
automatically labells them with 1,...,6), and the 1 tells R to
select only one paper.
<p></p>
Repeat the same command once again to roll the die once more
(you'll possiby get a different outcome). Of course, it is
tedious to repeat the command 100 times to roll the die 100 times.
So we use <b>simple random
sampling with replacement (SRSWR)</b>. It is 
like drawing 100 
random pieces of paper from those 6 pieces  <i>each drawn paper
being replaced before the next draw.</i>
In this way you can roll
the die any number of times. The R code is 
<font color="red">
<pre>
sample(6,100,replace=TRUE)
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
sample(6,100,replace=TRUE)
`));"/>
By the way, R is case-sensitive, so the <font size="+1" color="red"><code>TRUE</code></font> must be
in capitals. This may be abbreviated to 
<font color="red">
<pre>
sample(6,100,rep=T)
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
sample(6,100,rep=T)
`));"/>
Toissing a coin is similar, except that we have only two pieces
of paper:
<p></p>

<font color="red">
<pre>
sample(2,100,rep=T)
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
sample(2,100,rep=T)
`));"/>
Here instead of Heads and Tails you get 1's and 2's. You can tell
R explicitly to use the labels "H" and "T" as follows.
<font color="red">
<pre>
sample( c('H', 'T'), 100, rep=T)
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
sample( c('H', 'T'), 100, rep=T)
`));"/>
Note the <font size="+1" color="red"><code>c(...)</code></font>. That is R's way of making an array
of things. Here the things are the two labels "H" and "T". Note
the quotes around them. <font size="+1" color="red"><code>"T"</code></font>, for example, is just a
label, which is different from <font size="+1" color="red"><code>T</code></font>, an abbreviation
for <font size="+1" color="red"><code>TRUE</code></font>. 
<p></p>
Now you can see some statistical regularity at work. Toss a coin,
say 1000 times, and plot the cumulative proportion of
heads. Let's understand what I mean with a small example, say 5
tosses. If the outcomes are H, T, T, H, H, then the cumulative
proportions are $1,\frac 12,\frac 13,\frac 24,\frac 35.$ It is
always (no. of H's so far)/(no. of tosses so far). We shall plot
these five proportions against (no. of tosses so far). The R
command is
<font color="red">
<pre>
outcomes = sample(c('H','T'),1000,rep=T)
heads.so.far = cumsum(outcomes == 'H')
tosses.so.far = 1:1000
prop = heads.so.far/tosses.so.far
plot(prop, type='l')
</pre>
</font><input type="button"
value="Run in cloud"
onclick="javascript:aha(encodeURI(`
outcomes = sample(c('H','T'),1000,rep=T)
heads.so.far = cumsum(outcomes == 'H')
tosses.so.far = 1:1000
prop = heads.so.far/tosses.so.far
plot(prop, type='l')
`));"/>
Explanation of the code:
<ul>

<li>Here <font size="+1" color="red"><code>outcomes == "H"</code></font> checks which outcomes
are "H" and creates an array of 1 (yes) and 0 (no). </li>

<li>
<font size="+1" color="red"><code>cumsum</code></font> finds cumultative sums. 
</li>

<li>
<font size="+1" color="red"><code>1:1000</code></font> is just the array 1,2,...,1000. </li>

<li>
<font size="+1" color="red"><code>plot</code></font> makes a plot. The <font size="+1" color="red"><code>type="l"</code></font>
tells it to make a line plot.</li> 

</ul>
Notice how the line (which is random) jumps around a lot
initially, but eventually stabilises and seems to approach a
fixed value. Run the same code a number of times to see how the
initial part changes drastically from run to run, but the final
stable section remains unperturbed. 
<p></p>

Another popular random experiment is picking a number of cards at
random from a deck of cards. <table align="right" width="20%" border="1">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="pink">A standard deck of playing
cards consists of 52 cards. There are 4 <i>suits</i>
(spade <img width="20" align="" src="image/spade.png">
diamond <img width="20" align="" src="image/diamond.png">, heart
<img width="20" align="" src="image/heart.png"> and club <img width="20" align="" src="image/club.png">). There are 13 denominations under each suit: 2,...,10,
Jack, Queen, King and Ace. The cards of the three denominations
Jack, Queen and King are called picture cards.</td>

Suppose that we want to pick 5 random cards from a deck. We can
do this as
<font color="red">
<pre>
sample(52,5).

<h1><a
name="Problems for practice">Problems for practice</a></h1>
The following problems will help you to enjoy the course
better. However, no coding problem will be asked in the exams.
<ol type="">

<li>Simulate a Europian Roullette wheel. It is wheel with the
numbers 0,1,...,38 written along the circumference. The wheel is
spun and ball is dropped on it. When the wheel stops spinning the
ball is at one of the numbers randomly.
 </li>

<li>Roll a fair die 5000 times. Make a line plot showing the
running proportions of 6.</li>

<li>Suggest how you can shuffle a deck of 52 cards using R. </li>

<li>A slot machine consists of three reels (rings showing the
numbers 0,1,...,9). When it is activated by pulling a handle the
reels start turning randomly in different/same directions and
stop at random positions. One digit of each reel is visible
through a window. Simulate this in R.</li>
