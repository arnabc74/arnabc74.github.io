<h1><a
name="File management in C">File management in C</a></h1>

When you start learning to program, a good analogy to keep in mind
is this: 
<blockquote>
Just as we take inputs from our surroundings via our sensory
organs (eyes, ears etc), make decisions about them with our brain, and carry out
those decisions using our motor organs (hands and legs),
similarly, a computer gets its input from the connected input
devices (keyboard/mouse/touchpad), processes the input in its
CPU, and produces results on its output devices (screen/speaker etc).
</blockquote>
Most of the devices attached to a computer are either an input
device (keyboard/mouse/scanner/webcam etc) or an output device
(screen/speaker/printer). But there is one notable exception: a
device that is both input as well as output. In fact, this device
is present in human beings also. It cannot be seen, but its
presence can be felt. It is the <i>mind</i>. When you are reading this,
your eye sees some symbols, your brain construes meaning out of
them, but where does the output go? The output goes into your
mind. So here the mind acts as an output device. When later
you'll answer questions in an examination, where will the
information come from. Assuming honesty on your part, the
information should come from your mind. So there the mind acts as
an input device. 
<p></p>
The role of the mind is played by the <b>hard drive</b> of the
computer. It is a big box connected inside the
computer. Sometimes people use <i>external</i> hard drives, which
are connected from outside. The hard drive is basically a long
array of bytes. Each byte is a list of 8 bits. Each bit may be
set on or off by the computer. The most important property of the
hard drive is that the bit values set by the computer are
retained even after the computer is switched off, or the hard
drive is detached from it! It is this feature that makes it
behave like our mind. Our mind retains facts  even after the
source of facts is taken away. So whenever, your program needs to
produce output that should survive beyond the life time of the
program (<i>e.g.</i>,  needs to be preserved or shared via email or
uploaded to the internet), the output must be written to a hard
drive. Similarly, if your program wants to use information from
some past session (possibly output from some other program), then
it needs to read from a hard drive. As this is a common
requirement, and there are many programs all trying to read from
or write to the hard drive, it is easy to lose oneself in the
chaos. To prevent this the array of bytes in the hard drive is
organized in a particular way. We must have a clear mental picture
of a computational model of the hard drive in order to use it in
our program. 

<h2><a
name="Computational model">Computational model</a></h2>
There are two parts of the hard drive: the used part and unused
part. Think of the unused part as a l..o..n..g roll of paper
stretching for miles. For most purposes, you might consider it
virtually endless. The part in use is organized as a tree. Thus,
the computational model of the entire hard drive is like this:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/drive.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
The inner nodes of the tree are labelled red with various
names. These are called <b>folder</b>s. From each  leaf node we
see pieces of paper hanging. These are called <b>file</b>s. They
also have names (I have shown only three, in green). Notice that
the name <font color="red"><code>isi.c</code></font> has been used twice. In order to uniquely
specify a file, we give its entire <b>path</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, how to
reach that file from the top of the tree). The paths for for the
three files shown in green are:
<pre>
c:\user\isi.c
c:\user\samahriti\isi.c
c:\user\samahriti\chaplin.mp4
</pre>
Notice the backslashes. The are called the path separators. In
Linux systems, we use a forward slash for this purpose.
<p></p>

Each file, as I have said already, is like a piece of
paper. These papers are all torn off the huge roll of unused
supply. Unlike real paper, however, these pieces of papers may be
removed from the tree, 
erased, and returned to the roll for future use!

<h2><a
name="Enter C">Enter C</a></h2>
With this computational model in mind, we can now state how 
a C program manages this tree, i.e, performs file
management. There are basically three major operations:
<ul>

<li>Create a file</li>

<li>Delete a file</li>

<li>Write into a file</li>

<li>Read from a file</li>

</ul>
There is, however, one little complication. A file is just a list
of bytes, and each byte consists of 8 bits (<i>i.e.</i>, 0s and
1s). Now, 0s and 1s are good for computers, not for us humans. We
like to work with numbers and letters. So we encode numbers and
letters in terms of 0s and 1s. Thus, when we want to write numbers or
letters into a
file, we usually mean "first encode them in terms of 0s and 1s,
and then write the resulting 0s and 1s into the file." Similarly,
reading from a file usually means "read the 0s and 1s and then
decode them into numbers and letters." Of course, there may be
situations where you do want to write/read some 0s and 1s
directly. 
<p></p>
Accordingly there are two sets of functions provided by C: with
encoding/decoding or directly. We shall discuss the more
frequently used case first: with encoding/decoding.
<p></p>
Numbers and letters may be encoded in different ways in terms of
0s and 1s. One such is called ASCII (American Standard Code for
Information Interchange). This is no more the most popular
method (which is Unicode). However, when C was created, ASCII was
the main coding format. ASCII maps all the letters (upper/lower
case), digits, punctuation marks into bytes. Now, if you want to
encode a letter, you just apply ASCII. If you want to store an integer
you first reduce it to a list of digits (and possibly
a sign) using some base, and then apply ASCII to the
digits and sign. C allows the bases 10, 8 and 16. If you have a
number that is not an integer, then it is first converted to
decimal representation, and the resulting digits etc are encoded
using ASCII.

</dt>
<dd>The <font color="red"><code>fopen</code></font> function <b>opens a
file</b>. According to our computational model, this either
tears a piece of paper from the unused roll and attaches it to a
leaf of the tree (as here), or connects the pointer to an
existing file. The <font color="red"><code>"w"</code></font> stands for "write", and tells the
computer to start a new file. The name of the file is
"silly.txt". Notice that I have not mentioned the entire
path. In such a case, C assumes a default folder (more on this below).</dd>

<h3><a
name="Choosing the folder">Choosing the folder</a></h3>
When a C program (or any other program, for that matter) starts,
it chooses a particular folder as its default. This folder is
called its <b>working folder</b>. In most Windows computer, it is
something like 
<pre>
C:\Users\samahriti
</pre>
where <font color="red"><code>samahriti</code></font> is the login name of the user. If you are
starting your program from a terminal, then you can change the
name of the working folder as part of the prompt. But since this
is very much system dependent, I shall not discuss this further
here. Finding the working folder may take some time initially. 

<h2><a
name="Writing numbers">Writing numbers</a></h2>
As I have already mentioned, writing numbers is a two stage
process: first converting the number to a sequence of digits (and
possibly a decimal point and sign), and then applying ASCII
encoding. Also, there is a difference between how integers and
non-integers are handled. Integers may be represented using bases
10, 8 or 16. But non-integers must use base 10.

<dt>

</dt>
<dd>Now the <font color="red"><code>fprintf</code></font> function takes 3 arguments:
the first is the file pointer. The second is the <b>format</b>,
<i>i.e.</i>, how the first stage is to be done. Here the <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font>
means "base 10" ('d' for "decimal"). The third argument is the
integer to be printed (here it is $245+23=268$).</dd>

</dl>
</p>
If you replace the <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font> with <font color="red"><code>%o</code></font> or <font color="red"><code>%x</code></font>, you'll
get, respectively, base 8 or base 16.

<h2><a
name="Reading from a file">Reading from a file</a></h2>
To read from a file, the first prerequisite is that the file must
exist. Also, you must know what types of values are present
there, and in what order. For example, if a file merely contains
the word "Hello", and you are trying to read an integer from it,
then it will generate an error.

<dd>The <font color="red"><code>fscanf</code></font> function is for reading from a file.

You may use the format specifiers <font color="red"><code>%o</code></font>, <font color="red"><code>%x</code></font>
and <font color="red"><code>%f</code></font> as in case of <font color="red"><code>fprintf</code></font>.

<h3><a
name="Continuing,  stopping and skipping">Continuing,  stopping and skipping</a></h3>
Reading from a file is much more complicated than writing to a
file. When an ASCII file (often called a "text file") is read,
the computer reads it character by character, and then groups the
characters into numbers and other things. To understand this
process it helps to visualize a <b>reading head</b>. Think of it
as a thin line that is placed between two consecutive characters:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/readhead.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The red line is the read head</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
All the characters to the left of the reading head have already been
read, the characters to its right are yet to be read. Here, for
instance, we have read the <font color="red"><code>s</code></font> and are about to read
the <font color="red"><code>a</code></font>. Initially, the reading head is before the very
first character in the file.
<p></p>
The entire process launched by <font color="red"><code>fscanf</code></font> may be visualized as
a journey of the reading head over the contents of the file. It
can do three things:
<ul>

<li>move over the next character, and remember that character,</li>

<li>move over the next character, and ignore that character</li>

<li>stop</li>

</ul>
The rule governing these is simple: ignore any space character(s) in
the beginning, read as long as you can until the reading head
comes just before a character that cannot fit into the type of
thing you are reading (<i>e.g.</i>, integer).

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;For instance, if you issue the command:
<pre>
fscanf(fp, "%d%d",&amp;i,&amp;j);
</pre>
and <font color="red"><code>fp</code></font> points to a file containing this:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/read1.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The reading head is at the very left</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
Here the space characters are shown as grey boxes. According to
the reading policy just mentioned, the first <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font> causes the
reading head to come to this position:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/read2.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The ignored characters are underlined in red,
remembered ones in blue</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
Also, the integer 123 gets stored in the variable <font color="red"><code>i</code></font>. 
<p></p>

The next <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font> causes the reading head to move further (and
put the value 56 in <font color="red"><code>j</code></font>):
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/read3.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The reading head has finished its
journey</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
How did the reading head know that it has to stop after
the <font color="red"><code>6</code></font>? Because, the file ends there! We sometimes  imagine
a character called the <font color="red"><code>End Of File (EOF)</code></font> placed at the
very end. The reading head is not allowed to go past it.
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>
This example showed the simplest scenario. Now let's see how
things may go wrong. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
We shall again trace the same <font color="red"><code>fscanf</code></font>,
but now the file contents are:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/readbad1.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Notice the decimal point</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
Now the first <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font> causes the reading head to come to this position:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/readbad2.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Can't get past the decimal point!</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
But now it's stuck, because an integer cannot contain a decimal
point. So <font color="red"><code>i</code></font> gets the value 1.
<p></p>
Now the next <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font> comes into play. It tries to push the
reading head further. But the reading head remains
stuck., and  so <font color="red"><code>j</code></font> remains unchanged. Remember that no
error message is printed on screen. 
<img src="../image/box.png"></p>

Here is a third scenario:
<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
We run the command
<pre>
fscanf(fp, "%d%f",&amp;i,&amp;x);
</pre>
where the file contents are as in the last example. Here again
the first <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font> causes <font color="red"><code>i</code></font> to get the value 1, and, as
before, we
arrive at: 
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/readbad2.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>End of <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font></th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
Next the <font color="red"><code>%f</code></font> takes action. Now of course, the decimal point
is no more a taboo character, and reading head happily glides
over it, and eventually stops here:
<center>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th><img width="" src="image/readbad3.png"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>End of <font color="red"><code>%f</code></font></th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
As a result <font color="red"><code>x</code></font> get the value $0.23.$

<h2><a
name="A word of caution">A word of caution</a></h2>
What we have learned so far about <font color="red"><code>fscanf</code></font> pretty much
covers all that you'll need for the time being. However, there
are some exotic things that <font color="red"><code>fscanf</code></font> is capable
of. Unfortunately, beginners inadvertently get into those
situations by mistake and become puzzled some inexplicable
behaviour. We shall show one such. 

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b>&nbsp;
If instead of 
<pre>
fscanf(fp, "%d",&amp;i);
</pre>
you accidentally put a space before the <font color="red"><code>%d</code></font> to get
<pre>
fscanf(fp, " %d",&amp;i);
</pre>
then the behaviour will be drastically different. The program
will now look for an integer <i>following a single
space</i>. Similarly, typing
<pre>
fscanf(fp, "%d ",&amp;i);
</pre>
will cause it to look for an integer <i>followed by a single
space</i>. Similarly, 
<pre>
fscanf(fp, "%d %d",&amp;i,&amp;j);
</pre>
expects two integers <i>separated by exactly one space</i>. We
shall not go into the rationale behind this apparently weird
behaviour. Just remember not to put any space in the format
in <font color="red"><code>fscanf</code></font>. No such restriction for <font color="red"><code>fprintf</code></font>.
