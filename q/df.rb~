<HEAD2>Degrees of freedom</HEAD2>
Consider a random vector <M>\v X\in\rr^n,</M> where the <M>n</M>
components are independent <M>N(0,1)</M> random variables.  Then
its squared length, i.e., <M>\|\v X\|^2</M> is a random variable
whose distribution depends on the dimension <M>n.</M> In this
context, the dimension is a parameter of the distribution, and
this parameter is called the <B>degrees of freedom</B>. The
distribution is called the <M>\chi^2</M>-distribution
with <M>n</M> degrees of freedom, and
written <M>\chi^2_{(n)}.</M> 
<P/>
Now let's take some subspace <M>V\leq \rr^n </M> of
dimension <M>m,</M> say. Project <M>\v X</M> (orthogonally)
onto <M>V.</M> Let the projection be <M>\v Y.</M> Then <M>\v
Y</M> still has <M>n</M> components but can move only
inside <M>V,</M> a space of dimension only <M>m.</M> Then it may
be proved that <M>\|\v Y\|^2</M> has a <M>\chi^2_{(m)}</M>
distribution. We loosely say that <M>\|\v Y\|^2</M> has <M>m</M>
degrees of freedom.
<P/>
So far there is no mention of quadratic forms. Now they will come
into play.
<P/>
We may write <M>\|\v X\|^2</M> as <M>\v X'\v X = \v X' I_n \v
X,</M> a quadratic form. It had <M>n</M>  degrees of freedom
which also happened to be the rank of <M>I_n.</M> Now <M>\v Y =
P\v X,</M> where <M>P</M> is the projection matrix onto <M>V.</M>
Then <M>\|\v Y\|^2 = \v Y'\v Y = \v X'P'P\v X = \v X' P\v X,</M>
since <M>P</M> is symmetric and idempotent. Notice that the
degrees of freedom is again given by the rank of <M>P</M> (which
is the dimension of <M>V</M>). 
<P/>
Hence for a symmetric idempotent matrix <M>A</M> we say (loosely)
that <M>\v X' A \v X</M> has <M>r(A)</M> degrees of freedom. This
usage is only for symmetric, idempotent matrices. Also, for any
quadratic form the matrix is always considered to be
symmetric. So in your example <M>k=[[32]].</M>

<HEAD2>Are there cubic or higher forms?</HEAD2>
Yes, there are, but they are not usually called by these
names. Instead, first quadratic forms are generalised to bilinear
forms:
<Q>
A quadratic form is a function <M>f(\v x) = \v x' A\v x.</M> If
you allow the two difeent vectors on the two side, you get a
bilinear form, which is a function like <M>f(\v x, \v y) = \v
x'A\v y.</M> Here the matrix <M>A</M> may be any square matrix. 
</Q>
A bilinear map is linear in each of its arguments separately (i.e.,
when the other arguments are help fixed). Next, bilinear maps are
generalised to multilinear maps <M>f(\v x, \v y, \v z,...),</M>
which are linear in each of its arguments separately. 

<HEAD2>Are there nonhomogeneous quadratic forms?</HEAD2>
Yes and no. No because the expression <M>\v x' A\v x</M> has
exactly two components per term. However, you can accommodate
nonhomogeneous quadratic forms indirectly. Consider <M>2x^2-4x +
4.</M> Think of it as <M>2x^2-4xy + 4y^2,</M> but
with <M>y=1.</M> Then it is 
<D>
<MAT>x 1</MAT><MAT>2 & -2\\-2 & 4</MAT><MAT>x\\1</MAT>.
</D>
The conic-section formula is one application of this.
