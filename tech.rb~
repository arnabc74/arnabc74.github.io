<HEAD2>Overview</HEAD2>
The creation of a video proceeds in three stages. The first is
the preprocessing, where I create the props (images and
animations that will be overlaid on top of the main video).
The shooting is done in the second stage. The third stage puts
everything together. 
<HEAD2>Preprocessing</HEAD2>
Other than the overall planning of the topic, the main effort in
this stage is devoted to creating the props: images and
animations. The animations themselves start out their lives as a
sequence of images. All the images (whether part of such a
sequnce or not) are finally produced by inkscape. Ocassionally,
I need to import supporting materials created by Art Of Illusion
or R. The steps are:
<UL>
<LI>Issue the command "domakelec <n>" to start a folder
called <CODE>lec<n></CODE>. Henceforth I shall call it the
lecture folder. This folder contains an empty
subfolder called vid, and a template kdenlive file containing a
template title page, end page and the jingles.</LI>
<LI>For each topic to be covered in the video, I create a folder
to hold all the materials needed for it. With each such folder
is associated a filename prefix (e.g., p). Then the files
p1.svg, p2.svg, etc are the images to be displayed in that
order. The folder may contain other svg files as well, but they
will not be displayed. If need animations, then the image
sequence is also placed in this folder (but with some other
prefix).</LI>
<LI>If I plan to have some animation, the image files must be
stored in <png root><n>.png format, where <n> is a 4-digit 0-padded counter starting from 1. Then I
create the first svg file containing (linking, not embedding) the
first of these images. The svg file must be named
like <svg root><unpadded n>.svg. Then issuing the command
"doanim <svg root> <png root> <nframe>" creates the other svg files. </LI>
<LI>Once all the folders are prepared, I create a file called
order.txt in the lecture folder that contains the folder names
followed by the associated prefixes like this:
<PRE>
intro,i
fd,f
lm,lm
bon,b
bon2,bb
lsd,lsd
</PRE>
Each line is a comma-separated pair, the first part being the name
of a folder and the second part its associated prefix.
 </LI>
<LI>Next I issue the command "ipall y" in the lecture folder. This
converts all the prefixed svg files in the folders to
corresponding png files and also constructs index.txt files in
each folder with the names of the prefixed png files listed
alphabetically. It is the order of the names in the index.txt
file that determined the final order in which the images will
appear during the shooting. </LI>
<LI>If we are using animation then the last frame of the
animation is included in the index.txt by hand.</LI>
<LI>If I now issue the command 'doandro <folder>' from the
lecture folder, I can
preview the images in the shooting order. This is just for
checking. If any image needs changing, the command "ipall"
(without the "y") will create png from the updated
svg files bt not modify/create the index.txt files.</LI>
<LI>When I am satisfied, I give the command "dotransflip". This
creates a folder called "transfer" under the lecture folder, and
creates folders named 1, 2, 3 etc storing the flipped versions
of the prefixed png images from the folders (according the order
specified by order.txt). The index.txt file in each folder is
copied, as well.</LI>
<LI>Finally, I transfer the "transfer" folder to my mobile.</LI>
</UL>
<HEAD2>Shooting</HEAD2>
For shooting I start my Overlay app, select the folder, start the
camera, do OK syncing, ad start speaking. Holding the camera with
my right hand at an arm's length is particularly convenient for
advancing through the images with my index finger unseen by the
camera. Also, my left hand is free for gesturing. However, this
is somewhat tiring for the right hand, and is unsuitable for
shoots longer than 5 minutes or so. For the longer shoots I hold
the camera with my left hand, and use the right hand to both
gesture and advance. 
<P/>
Staring into the camera is not a good idea, as this makes my eyes
look abnormally squinted. If I look at the visuals, then I indeed
appear to be looking at the visuals during the video. This is an
unplanned bonus. When I am not looking at the visuals, I prefer
to look away casually with only occasional glances at the
camera. I generally walk at a leisurely pace during the shoot. 
<P/>
Everytime I move to a new topic, I change my location. I shoot
the location for a few seconds both as an establishing shot, as
well as a restful prelude. 
<P/>
This stage produces two types of output: the recorded videos and
a cue.txt file in each topic folder inside the transfer folder.

<HEAD2>Postprocessing</HEAD2>
This stage starts with transfering the output of the shooting
stage into the laptop. All the videos are stored inside the vid
folder, and the cue.txt files are to be copied to the appropriate
topic folders. This latter job is facilitate by the docue
<lecture number> command
(to be issued from inside (a copy of) the transfer folder of my
phone. 
<P/>
Now we need to run the command doamelt from inside the lecture
folder. This will create an mlt forlder under the lecture folder,
and populate with mlt files based on the cue.txt files in each
topic folder. If there is some animation, then I need to modify
the appropriate cue.txt file by adding the triple
"<png root> <start number> <end number" to the line <I>after</I>
where the animation is to be inserted.
