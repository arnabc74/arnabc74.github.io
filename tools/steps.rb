<HEAD1>The steps to create a video</HEAD1>

<HEAD2>Stage 0: Mental preparation</HEAD2>
Decide about how many shooting sessions you need, and how many of
these will have overlays. For each such session, make a
storyboard with frame numbers.
<HEAD2>Stage 1: Creating the materials</HEAD2>
One folder for each session with overlay. We shall call it an
overlay folder.
<HEAD3>Using Synfig</HEAD3>
Each overlay folder has one or more synfig file.
Start with a 640x480 canvas. Create all the materials. For each
storyboard frame add a waypoint before and after each
segment. Don't forget to enter the video mode.
