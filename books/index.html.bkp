is a busy person, and may need a couple of reminders (if not more!) before he
finally responds.
<li><b>Price:</b> Rs 180 (each of vol 1 and vol 2), Rs 295 (vol3) and Rs 250 (Modern Algebra).

<h3>What is special about the books?</h3>

The books are written in a mixture of English and Bengali in a
way that I have not seen elsewhere. These are like English books
explained in Bengali. The treatment is elementary as
the target audience consists mostly of undergraduate students
studying (or suffering) in what is commonly called the "degree
course in mathematics" under Calcutta University. It contains
detailed solutions (in English) of past 10 years' exam papers, and also
detailed discussion (in Bengali) of the mathematical concepts behind them.
<p>
The books are flooded with diagrams for visualising concepts.

<h3>Why did I write these books?</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Most of the target students come from a Bengali background, and find
it difficult to digest English books. It is not the English
terminology that they find difficult, rather the explanations. 
As a result most standard international books are beyond their
reach. The only books they can (and do) read are the books by
local authors. To reduce the amount of English, these books hardly explain anything at all. They are
just a jumble of solved problems (often wrongly done, almost
always badly presented). I wanted to create books where all the
terminology are in English, but the explanations are in Bengali. 
<li>
The syllabus of Calcutta University gives undue stress on some
esoteric results that not commonly discussed in standard books. 
These results are mentioned only in the dryly written books by
local authors, who often skip important concepts to
dwell on tricky exam problems. As the syllabus is quite heavy, few students have
the time and energy to read the local books as well as standard
books. In order to survive in the exams, they end up reading
only the local books. I wanted to write books that will explain
the true spirit of real analysis, but also help the students to
answer the exam problems.  
<li>Most authors seem unwilling to provide enough diagrams in
their books. A typical real analysis book by a local author
provides no diagram at all. Even standard international
books use diagrams quite sparingly. I wanted to write a book that
could even pass as a picture album of real analysis. After all, a
picture is worth a thousand words!
<li>
We Bengalis somehow seem ashamed of our language. We 
understand Bengali better than English, but so many of us
would rather die than admit this simple fact. And many a
potential talent indeed dies at the altar of this ridiculous
attitude. I wanted to write books that will explain concepts in
Bengali no less (if not more) lucidly than any book of international standard.
</ol> 

<h3>I hope that the books...</h3>
<UL>
<LI>...can be read by ordinary students.</LI>
<LI>...would help students to pass the exams.</LI>
<LI>...would explain the intuitive concepts.</LI>
<LI>...are written completely rigourously.</LI>
<LI>...would enable students to read standard books on the
subject later.</LI>
</UL>

<h3>What are others saying?</h3>
Not many know of this effort yet. But the awareness is growing
rapidly.  I have got
numerous phone calls from students and teachers (known as well as
unknown) exuberantly praising the books. Some others used to 
scoff at the idea of a English book explained in Bengali, and
would not even care to look into it. But I have not heard from
any of them for quite some time. 

<h3>How <i>you</i> can help</h3>

I had started the endeavour as a purely personal project. But of
course a project of this nature can hardly survive without active
participation of others. If you feel like lending a helping
hand then here are some suggestions:
<UL>
<LI><b>You may buy the books:</b> No, I do not say this to fatten my
purse. But when you buy the books (or at least send an
email to <a href="mailto:mde@saratbookhouse.com">my
distributor</a> with a request to buy), you are
sending <i>him</i> the valuable message that the books are in
demand.  He does not care about my dreams. Market demand (as
perceived by him in terms of cash) is his only motivation.</LI>
<LI><b>Spread the word:</b> Try to dispell the three common
myths:
<OL>
<LI>Myth 1: It is a book for the elite students only.</LI>
<LI>Myth 2: This is yet another Satyen Bose-ian effort to
construct ridiculous Bengali technical terms.</LI>
<LI>Myth 3: It is just  à¦†à¦à¦¤à¦²à¦¾à¦®à¦¿  (worthless show of intellectual acumen).</LI>
</OL>
